Your goal is to extract information from an HTML table, its caption, and the paragraphs where the table is mentioned. You must produce a structured “serialization”, called claim, for every item of interest. 
The serialization is simply a set of specifications and metrics with the respective values. Each specification is a pair with the structure: |name, value|. Every item (i.e., claim) represents one experimental result contextualized by the set of specifications, which need to be extracted along with the specifications in the form of two vectors [metrics], [outcomes]. Hence, this is the format for a complete claim:
|n1, v1|, |n2, v2|, .., |n_i, v_i|, [metric1, metric2, .., metric_i], [outcome1, outcome2, .., outcome_i]
