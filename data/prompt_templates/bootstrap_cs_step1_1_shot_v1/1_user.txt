Your goal is to extract information from an HTML table, its caption, and the paragraphs where the table is mentioned. You must produce a structured “serialization”, called claim, for every item of interest. 
The serialization is simply a set of specifications and metrics with the respective values. Each specification is a pair with the structure: |name, value|. Every item (i.e., claim) represents one experimental result contextualized by the set of specifications, which need to be extracted along with the specifications in the form of two vectors [metrics], [outcomes]. Hence, this is the format for a complete claim:
|n1, v1|, |n2, v2|, .., |n_i, v_i|, [metric1, metric2, .., metric_i], [outcome1, outcome2, .., outcome_i]
where:
1. Each specification pair has both a name and a value.
2. Every piece of data or information from the table, caption, footnote or paragraph(s) that helps characterize or define that row/item should be turned into a specification.
3. When you can, you should always inferece pairs, or elements of pairs, from table’s captions, footnotes and and given paragraph(s).
4. You must consider all rows and columns of the table, using all of each cell’s content.
5. Each claim should contain pairs that contextualize only the experimental results reported in the claim. 
6. Infer group boundaries based on the structure of the table and the accompanying text. When you detect that a specific experimental result is associated with one particular context (whatever label or specification that might be), serialize them into one claim, and if another context appears later, start a new claim.
7. Contexts might differ even by just one value of one specification.
8. Metrics are grouped together if they contextualize each other, otherwise different claims are produced, even if the set of specifications is the same.
9. It is perfectly fine for a claim to have just one metric and one outcome.
10. Respond only with the serializations themselves—nothing else. Do not use bullet points, do not say “and so on,” and do not provide any explanations.
11. Start serialization with <start-claims> and end it with <end-claims>.

The following is an example of an extraction of just the first two claims.
