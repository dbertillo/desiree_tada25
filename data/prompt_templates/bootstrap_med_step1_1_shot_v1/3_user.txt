Pairs (or just their name or value) can be present in caption or the paragraph in which the table was cited. Leverage all data available to extract as many specifications as possible for each experimental result. The goal is to serialize the most amount of data from the whole content in a structured form suited to be stored in a database.
Please, to start serialize just the first two claims from the following table, caption, footnote and paragraphs and do not omit any pairs you can find.
Citations: #placeholder{citations}
Caption: #placeholder{caption}
Table: #placeholder{table_head}
Footnotes: #placeholder{footnotes}
