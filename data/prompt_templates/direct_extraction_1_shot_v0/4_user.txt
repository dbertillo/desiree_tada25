\n\n Do not omit any specifications you can find. If a row/item has no numeric outcome, simply leave out the “metric” and “outcome” specifications and capture everything else. If you are considering a cell, use ALL of its textual content (strip away LaTeX/HTML). Respond ONLY with the serialized data and do NOT enumerate them.
