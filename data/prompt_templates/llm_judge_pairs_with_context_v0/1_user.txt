You task is to act as a judge to evaluate an extraction task. I automatically extracted data into a triplet format structure called "claims" from table and unstructured text from a scientific paper. Each row is a claim following the format:

|spec1, value1|, ..., |spec_n, value_n|, [metric1, ..., metric_m], [outcome1, ..., outcome_m]

Where:
	•	The |spec, value| pairs define the context setting of the experiment.
	•	Specifications were extracted or infer using all available sources: table cells, caption, footnotes, paragraphs, and citations.
	•	The metrics vector contains all measured variables or performance metrics.
	•	The outcomes vector contains the corresponding values or results for each metric.
	•	A claim may still contain only contextual specifications if no experimental result is present (i.e., metrics and outcomes vectors are not present)

The following is the table with the relevat context (paragraphs where the table is mentioned, caption, the actual table and footnotes):
	•	Citations: #placeholder{citations}
	•	Caption: #placeholder{caption}
	•	Table: #placeholder{table}
	•	Footnotes: #placeholder{footnotes}

Data present many syntactic ambiguity and evaluation is not easy. I present to you an extracted claims and a claim from the ground truth. Given the context and the two claims, you need to answer if the two are the same claim or not. 

As a generic guideline, a claim is the same if the it holds the same information, otherwise it is not. Your answer must be wrapped between tags <match>answer</match> and needs to be only "yes" or "no".

Extracted claim:
#placeholder{extracted_claim}

Ground truth claims:
#placeholder{ground_truth_claim}

You must answer ONLY with "yes" or "no" inside the <match> tag. Do not produce any more comment.
