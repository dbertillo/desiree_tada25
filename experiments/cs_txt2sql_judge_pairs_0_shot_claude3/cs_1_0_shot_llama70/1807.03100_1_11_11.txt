The extracted claim and the ground truth claims are not exactly the same. While the extracted claim contains some correct information, it is missing crucial details present in the ground truth claims. Specifically:

1. The extracted claim doesn't specify the split (Dev or Test) which is present in the ground truth claims.
2. The extracted claim doesn't include any measures or outcomes, while the ground truth claims include specific accuracy metrics and their corresponding values.
3. The extracted claim doesn't mention the unit of measurement (%), which is included in the ground truth claims.

Given these differences, my classification is:

<classification>no</classification>

The extracted claim appears to be a partial representation of the information, lacking the specific performance metrics and results that are present in the ground truth claims.
