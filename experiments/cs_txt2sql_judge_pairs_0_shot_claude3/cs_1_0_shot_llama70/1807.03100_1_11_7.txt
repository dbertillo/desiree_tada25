The extracted claim and the ground truth claims are not exactly the same. While the extracted claim contains some correct information, it is missing crucial details and measurements that are present in the ground truth claims. Specifically:

1. The extracted claim correctly identifies the model (Pointer-SQL + EG (5)), the dataset (WikiSQL), the decoding strategy (Execution-Guided), and the beam size (5).

2. However, the extracted claim is missing important information such as the split (Dev/Test), the unit of measurement (%), and most importantly, the actual measures (Syntactical Accuracy and Execution Accuracy) and their corresponding outcomes.

3. In the ground truth, there are four separate claims for this specific model configuration, covering both Dev and Test splits, and both Syntactical and Execution Accuracy measures with their respective outcomes.

Given these differences, my classification is:

<classification>no</classification>

The extracted claim, while partially correct, does not fully capture the information present in the ground truth claims for this model configuration.
