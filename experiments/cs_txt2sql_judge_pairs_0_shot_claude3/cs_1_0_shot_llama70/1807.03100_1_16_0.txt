After comparing the extracted claim with the ground truth claims, I can provide the following answer:

<classification>yes</classification>

Comment: The extracted claim matches the ground truth claim for the Coarse2Fine model on the WikiSQL dataset, measuring syntactical accuracy (Accsyn) on the Test split with a value of 71.7%. While the extracted claim doesn't explicitly mention the "Test" split, it correctly captures the model, dataset, accuracy type, and outcome value. The ground truth claim provides more detailed information, but the core information is the same in both claims.
