After comparing the extracted claim with the ground truth claims, I can provide the following answer:

<classification>yes</classification>

The extracted claim matches one of the ground truth claims. Specifically, it corresponds to the claim:

{'subject': {'Model': 'Coarse2Fine', 'Dataset': 'WikiSQL', 'Split': 'Test', 'Unit': '%'}, 'measures': ['Execution Accuracy'], 'outcomes': ['78.4']}

The extracted claim correctly identifies the model (Coarse2Fine), the dataset (WikiSQL), the accuracy type (Execution), and the outcome (78.4%). While the extracted claim doesn't specify the split (Test) or the unit (%), it still captures the core information present in the ground truth claim.
