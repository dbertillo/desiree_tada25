After comparing the extracted claim with the ground truth claims, I can conclude:

<classification>yes</classification>

The extracted claim matches the ground truth claim for the Coarse2Fine + EG (3) model on the WikiSQL dataset for syntactical accuracy (Accsyn) in the Dev split. Both claims have the same model, dataset, accuracy type, and outcome value of 75.6%. While the extracted claim uses "Accsyn" and the ground truth uses "Syntactical Accuracy", these refer to the same metric. The ground truth provides additional details like the split (Dev) and unit (%), but the core information is the same.
