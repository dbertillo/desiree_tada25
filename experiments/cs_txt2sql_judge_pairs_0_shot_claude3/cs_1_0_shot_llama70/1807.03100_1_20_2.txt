After comparing the extracted claim with the ground truth claims, I can provide the following answer:

<classification>no</classification>

The extracted claim does not exactly match any of the ground truth claims. While it correctly identifies the model as "Coarse2Fine + EG (3)" and includes some correct information like the dataset (WikiSQL) and beam size (3), it lacks specific details such as the split (Dev or Test) and the accuracy measures (Syntactical Accuracy and Execution Accuracy) with their corresponding outcomes. Additionally, the extracted claim has empty measures and outcomes lists, which is not consistent with the ground truth claims that include specific measures and outcomes for each model configuration.
