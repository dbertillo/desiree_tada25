After comparing the extracted claim with the ground truth claims, I can conclude:

<classification>yes</classification>

The extracted claim matches one of the ground truth claims. Specifically, it corresponds to the claim:

{'subject': {'Model': 'Coarse2Fine + EG (3)', 'Strategy': 'Execution-guided', 'Beam size': '3', 'Dataset': 'WikiSQL', 'Split': 'Test', 'Unit': '%'}, 'measures': ['Syntactical Accuracy'], 'outcomes': ['74.8']}

The extracted claim correctly identifies the model (Coarse2Fine + EG (3)), the dataset (WikiSQL), the accuracy type (Syntactical), and the outcome (74.8%). While the extracted claim uses "Accsyn" instead of "Syntactical Accuracy", these refer to the same metric as explained in the table caption. The extracted claim doesn't specify the split (Test) or unit (%), but the information it does contain is correct and matches the ground truth claim.
