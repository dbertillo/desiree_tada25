After comparing the extracted claim with the ground truth claims, I can conclude:

<classification>yes</classification>

The extracted claim matches the ground truth claim for the Coarse2Fine + EG (3) model on the WikiSQL dataset, specifically for the Test split and Execution Accuracy metric. Both claims show an accuracy of 83.0%. While the extracted claim doesn't explicitly mention the Test split, it correctly identifies the model, dataset, accuracy type, and outcome value.
