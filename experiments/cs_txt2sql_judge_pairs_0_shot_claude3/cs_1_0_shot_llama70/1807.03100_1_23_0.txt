After comparing the extracted claim with the ground truth claims, I can conclude:

<classification>yes</classification>

The extracted claim matches the ground truth claim for the Coarse2Fine + EG (5) model on the WikiSQL dataset, measuring syntactical accuracy (Accsyn) on the Dev split with a value of 76.0%. While the extracted claim doesn't explicitly mention the Dev split or the unit (%), these can be inferred from the context provided in the table and caption. The information conveyed is essentially the same, so they can be considered the same claim.
