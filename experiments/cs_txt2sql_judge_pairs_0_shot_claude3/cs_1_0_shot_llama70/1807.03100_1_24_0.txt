To evaluate if the extracted claim matches any of the ground truth claims, I'll compare the key information:

The extracted claim is for:
- Model: Coarse2Fine + EG (5)
- Dataset: WikiSQL
- Accuracy Type: Execution
- Metric: Accex (Execution Accuracy)
- Outcome: 84.0

Looking through the ground truth claims, there is one that matches this information:

{'subject': {'Model': 'Coarse2Fine + EG (5)', 'Strategy': 'Execution-guided', 'Beam size': '5', 'Dataset': 'WikiSQL', 'Split': 'Dev', 'Unit': '%'}, 'measures': ['Execution Accuracy'], 'outcomes': ['84.0']}

This ground truth claim matches the extracted claim in terms of the model, dataset, accuracy type, and outcome. The only difference is that the ground truth provides more specific information about the split (Dev) and includes additional details like strategy and beam size.

Given that the core information (model, dataset, accuracy type, and outcome) matches, I would consider these to be the same claim.
