The extracted claim and the ground truth claims are not exactly the same. While the extracted claim contains some correct information, it is missing crucial details present in the ground truth claims. Specifically:

1. The extracted claim doesn't include the split (Dev or Test) information.
2. It's missing the Unit (%) information.
3. Most importantly, it doesn't include any measures or outcomes, which are present in the ground truth claims.

Therefore, my classification is:

<classification>no</classification>

The extracted claim appears to be a partial representation of the information, focusing only on some aspects of the experimental setup without including the actual results.
