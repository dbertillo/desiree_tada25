After analyzing the extracted claim and the ground truth claims, I can provide the following answer:

<classification>yes</classification>

The extracted claim matches one of the ground truth claims. Specifically, it corresponds to the claim:

{'subject': {'Model': 'Coarse2Fine + EG (5)', 'Strategy': 'Execution-guided', 'Beam size': '5', 'Dataset': 'WikiSQL', 'Split': 'Test', 'Unit': '%'}, 'measures': ['Syntactical Accuracy'], 'outcomes': ['75.4']}

The extracted claim correctly identifies the model (Coarse2Fine + EG (5)), the dataset (WikiSQL), the accuracy type (Syntactical), and the outcome (75.4%). While the extracted claim uses "Accsyn" instead of "Syntactical Accuracy", these refer to the same metric as explained in the table caption. The extracted claim doesn't specify the split (Test) or unit (%), but the information it does contain is consistent with the ground truth claim.
