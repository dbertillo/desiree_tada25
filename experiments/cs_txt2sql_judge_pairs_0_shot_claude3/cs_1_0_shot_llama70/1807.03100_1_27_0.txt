To evaluate if the extracted claim matches any of the ground truth claims, I'll compare the key information:

1. Model: Coarse2Fine + EG (5)
2. Dataset: WikiSQL
3. Accuracy Type: Execution
4. Metric: Accex (which corresponds to Execution Accuracy)
5. Outcome: 83.8

Looking at the ground truth claims, there is one that matches all these criteria:

{'subject': {'Model': 'Coarse2Fine + EG (5)', 'Strategy': 'Execution-guided', 'Beam size': '5', 'Dataset': 'WikiSQL', 'Split': 'Test', 'Unit': '%'}, 'measures': ['Execution Accuracy'], 'outcomes': ['83.8']}

This ground truth claim has the same model, dataset, accuracy type, and outcome. The only difference is that the ground truth provides more specific information about the split (Test) and includes additional details like strategy and beam size.

Given that all the core information matches, I would consider these to be the same claim.
