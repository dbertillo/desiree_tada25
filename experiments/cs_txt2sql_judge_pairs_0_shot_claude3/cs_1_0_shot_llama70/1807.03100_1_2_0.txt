After analyzing the extracted claim and the ground truth claims, I can conclude that:

<classification>yes</classification>

The extracted claim corresponds to the third claim in the ground truth list. Both refer to the Pointer-SQL model's syntactical accuracy on the WikiSQL dataset for the Test split, with a value of 62.3%. While the extracted claim uses "Accsyn" and the ground truth uses "Syntactical Accuracy", they are referring to the same metric as defined in the context provided.
