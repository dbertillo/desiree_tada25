After analyzing the extracted claim and the ground truth claims, I can provide the following assessment:

<classification>yes</classification>

The extracted claim matches one of the ground truth claims. Specifically, it corresponds to the following ground truth claim:

{'subject': {'Model': 'Pointer-SQL + EG (3)', 'Strategy': 'Execution-guided', 'Beam size': '3', 'Dataset': 'WikiSQL', 'Split': 'Dev', 'Unit': '%'}, 'measures': ['Execution Accuracy'], 'outcomes': ['77.3']}

The extracted claim correctly identifies the model (Pointer-SQL + EG (3)), the dataset (WikiSQL), the accuracy type (Execution), and the outcome (77.3%). While the extracted claim doesn't explicitly mention the 'Dev' split or the unit (%), these can be inferred from the context provided in the table and caption. The measure "Accex" in the extracted claim corresponds to "Execution Accuracy" in the ground truth.
