The extracted claim and the ground truth claims are not exactly the same, but the extracted claim is a partial match to some of the ground truth claims. Specifically, it matches the context of the Pointer-SQL + EG (3) model, but it's missing the specific accuracy measures and outcomes. The closest matching ground truth claims are those for Pointer-SQL + EG (3) with beam size 3, but the extracted claim lacks the split (Dev/Test) information and the actual accuracy values.

Given that the extracted claim is incomplete compared to the ground truth claims, my classification is:

<classification>no</classification>
