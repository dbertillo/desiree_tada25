To evaluate if the extracted claim matches any of the ground truth claims, I'll compare the key information:

1. Model: Pointer-SQL + EG (3)
2. Dataset: WikiSQL
3. Accuracy Type: Execution
4. Metric: Accex (which corresponds to Execution Accuracy)
5. Outcome: 76.9

Looking at the ground truth claims, there is one that matches this information:

{'subject': {'Model': 'Pointer-SQL + EG (3)', 'Strategy': 'Execution-guided', 'Beam size': '3', 'Dataset': 'WikiSQL', 'Split': 'Test', 'Unit': '%'}, 'measures': ['Execution Accuracy'], 'outcomes': ['76.9']}

This ground truth claim matches the extracted claim in all key aspects. The only additional information in the ground truth is the Split (Test) and Unit (%), which doesn't contradict the extracted claim.

Therefore, my answer is:

<classification>yes</classification>

The extracted claim and the matching ground truth claim represent the same information, despite some differences in formatting and level of detail.
