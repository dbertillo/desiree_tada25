After comparing the extracted claim with the ground truth claims, I can conclude:

<classification>yes</classification>

The extracted claim matches the first claim in the ground truth list. Both refer to the SQLNet model on the Spider dataset for the Dev Set, with the same citation and accuracy score of 10.9. The only difference is that the ground truth claim specifies "Exact Set Match Accuracy" while the extracted claim simply says "Accuracy", but this can be considered the same measure in this context.
