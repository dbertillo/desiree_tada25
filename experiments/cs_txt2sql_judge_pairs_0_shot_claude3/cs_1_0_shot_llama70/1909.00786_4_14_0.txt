After comparing the extracted claim with the ground truth claims, I can conclude:

<classification>yes</classification>

The extracted claim matches one of the ground truth claims. Specifically, it corresponds to the claim:

{'subject': {'Model': 'Ours', 'Dataset': 'Spider', 'Evaluation': 'Dev Set'}, 'measures': ['Exact Set Match Accuracy'], 'outcomes': ['36.4']}

The extracted claim correctly captures the model ("Ours"), the dataset (Spider), the evaluation set (Dev Set), and the accuracy score (36.4). While the extracted claim uses "Accuracy" instead of "Exact Set Match Accuracy", this is a minor difference in terminology that doesn't change the core information conveyed. Therefore, these can be considered the same claim.
