After comparing the extracted claim with the ground truth claims, I can confirm that the extracted claim matches one of the ground truth claims. Specifically, it corresponds to the claim for the "Ours" model on the Spider dataset's Test Set, with an accuracy of 32.9%.

<classification>yes</classification>

The extracted claim correctly captures the key information: the model ("Ours"), the dataset (Spider), the evaluation set (Test Set), and the accuracy score (32.9). While the ground truth claim uses "Exact Set Match Accuracy" as the measure and the extracted claim simply uses "Accuracy", this difference is not significant enough to consider them as different claims, especially given the context of the table and the typical metrics used in text-to-SQL tasks.
