After analyzing the extracted claim and the ground truth claims, I can provide the following assessment:

<classification>yes</classification>

The extracted claim corresponds to the second-to-last claim in the ground truth list. Both claims refer to the same model ("+ utterance-table BERT Embedding" in the extracted claim, which is equivalent to "Ours + utterance-table BERT Embedding" in the ground truth), the same dataset (Spider), the same evaluation set (Dev Set), and the same outcome (57.6). 

The only difference is in the naming of the measure: the extracted claim uses "Accuracy" while the ground truth uses "Exact Set Match Accuracy". However, in the context of the Spider dataset for text-to-SQL tasks, these terms are often used interchangeably to refer to the same metric. Therefore, we can consider these claims to be essentially the same.
