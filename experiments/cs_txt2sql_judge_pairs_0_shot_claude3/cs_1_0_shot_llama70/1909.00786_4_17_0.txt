After analyzing the extracted claim and the ground truth claims, I can provide the following classification:

<classification>yes</classification>

The extracted claim matches the last claim in the ground truth list. Both refer to the model "Ours + utterance-table BERT Embedding" on the Spider dataset, evaluated on the Test Set, with an accuracy of 53.4. The only difference is in the naming of the accuracy measure, which is implied in the extracted claim but explicitly stated as "Exact Set Match Accuracy" in the ground truth. However, this difference doesn't change the core information conveyed by the claim.
