After comparing the extracted claim with the ground truth claims, I can confirm that the extracted claim matches one of the ground truth claims. Specifically, it corresponds to the second claim in the ground truth list:

{'subject': {'Model': 'SQLNet', 'Dataset': 'Spider', 'Citation': 'Xu etal. (2017)', 'Evaluation': 'Test Set'}, 'measures': ['Exact Set Match Accuracy'], 'outcomes': ['12.4']}

The extracted claim and this ground truth claim share the same information:
1. Model: SQLNet
2. Citation: Xu etal. (2017)
3. Dataset: Spider
4. Set/Evaluation: Test Set
5. Outcome: 12.4

The only difference is that the extracted claim uses "Accuracy" as the measure, while the ground truth specifies "Exact Set Match Accuracy". However, in the context of the Spider dataset, these terms are often used interchangeably to refer to the same metric.

Therefore, my classification is:

<classification>yes</classification>
