After comparing the extracted claim with the ground truth claims, I can conclude:

<classification>yes</classification>

The extracted claim matches one of the ground truth claims. Specifically, it corresponds to the fourth claim in the ground truth list:

{'subject': {'Model': 'SyntaxSQLNet', 'Dataset': 'Spider', 'Citation': 'Yu etal. (2018b)', 'Evaluation': 'Test Set'}, 'measures': ['Exact Set Match Accuracy'], 'outcomes': ['19.7']}

The extracted claim contains the same information, although with slight differences in naming conventions:
1. The 'Model' and 'Citation' are the same.
2. 'Dataset' is correctly identified as 'Spider'.
3. 'Set' in the extracted claim corresponds to 'Evaluation' in the ground truth.
4. The measure 'Accuracy' can be interpreted as 'Exact Set Match Accuracy'.
5. The outcome value '19.7' is identical.

These minor differences do not change the core information conveyed, so the claims can be considered the same.
