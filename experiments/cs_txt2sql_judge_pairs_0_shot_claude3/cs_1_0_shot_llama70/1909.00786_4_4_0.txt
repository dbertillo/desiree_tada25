After comparing the extracted claim with the ground truth claims, I can provide the following classification:

<classification>yes</classification>

The extracted claim corresponds to the ground truth claim:
{'subject': {'Model': 'SyntaxSQLNet + data augmentation', 'Dataset': 'Spider', 'Citation': 'Yu etal. (2018b)', 'Evaluation': 'Dev Set'}, 'measures': ['Exact Set Match Accuracy'], 'outcomes': ['24.8']}

While there are some minor differences in the naming conventions and structure, the essential information is the same:
1. The model is "+data augmentation" (extracted) which matches "SyntaxSQLNet + data augmentation" (ground truth)
2. The citation is the same: "Yu etal. (2018b)"
3. The dataset is Spider
4. The set/evaluation is "Dev Set"
5. The outcome value is 24.8
6. The measure, while named differently ("Accuracy" vs "Exact Set Match Accuracy"), refers to the same metric in this context.

Therefore, these claims can be considered the same.
