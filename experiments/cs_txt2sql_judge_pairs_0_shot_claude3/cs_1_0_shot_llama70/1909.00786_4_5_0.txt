After comparing the extracted claim with the ground truth claims, I can provide the following classification:

<classification>yes</classification>

The extracted claim corresponds to the ground truth claim:
{'subject': {'Model': 'SyntaxSQLNet + data augmentation', 'Dataset': 'Spider', 'Citation': 'Yu etal. (2018b)', 'Evaluation': 'Test Set'}, 'measures': ['Exact Set Match Accuracy'], 'outcomes': ['27.2']}

While there are some minor differences in the representation, the core information is the same:
1. The model is "+data augmentation" (which is shorthand for "SyntaxSQLNet + data augmentation")
2. The citation is "Yu etal. (2018b)"
3. The dataset is Spider
4. The set is "Test Set"
5. The outcome value is 27.2

The measure in the ground truth is more specific ("Exact Set Match Accuracy" vs just "Accuracy"), but this doesn't change the fundamental information conveyed by the claim. Therefore, these can be considered the same claim.
