After comparing the extracted claim with the ground truth claims, I can provide the following classification:

<classification>yes</classification>

The extracted claim matches the 7th claim in the ground truth list. Both claims refer to the Lee (2019) model on the Spider dataset for the Dev Set, with an accuracy/performance of 28.5. The only minor difference is that the ground truth claim specifies the measure as "Accuracy" while the extracted claim uses "[Accuracy]", but this difference is negligible in terms of the information conveyed.
