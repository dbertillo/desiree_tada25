After comparing the extracted claim with the ground truth claims, I can conclude:

<classification>yes</classification>

The extracted claim matches the 8th claim in the ground truth list. Both refer to the Lee (2019) model on the Spider dataset for the Test Set, with an accuracy/Exact Set Match Accuracy of 24.3. The only difference is that the extracted claim uses "Accuracy" while the ground truth uses "Exact Set Match Accuracy", but these are likely referring to the same metric in this context.
