To determine if the extracted claim is the same as one of the ground truth claims, I'll compare the key information:

Extracted claim:
- Model: Template
- Evaluation Set: Development
- Evaluation Metric: BLEU
- BLEU Score: 9.5

The matching ground truth claim is:
{'subject': {'Model': 'Template', 'Dataset': 'Dev', 'Evaluation': 'Automatic'}, 'measures': ['BLEU'], 'outcomes': ['9.5']}

Both claims refer to the Template model, on the Development/Dev set, with a BLEU score of 9.5. The ground truth adds that it's an automatic evaluation, which is implied but not explicitly stated in the extracted claim.

Given this comparison:

<classification>yes</classification>

The claims contain the same core information, despite minor differences in terminology (e.g., "Evaluation Set" vs "Dataset").
