After comparing the extracted claim with the ground truth claims, I can conclude:

<classification>yes</classification>

The extracted claim matches the ground truth claim for the Pointer-generator model's LCR score on the Test set. Both claims contain the same information: the model (Pointer-generator), the evaluation set (Test), the metric (LCR), and the outcome (35.0%). The ground truth claim provides additional context about the sample size and evaluators, but the core information is the same.
