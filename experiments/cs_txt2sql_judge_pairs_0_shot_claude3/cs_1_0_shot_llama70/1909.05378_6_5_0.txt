After comparing the extracted claim with the ground truth claims, I can confirm that the extracted claim matches one of the ground truth claims.

<classification>yes</classification>

The extracted claim corresponds to the 6th claim in the ground truth list:
{'subject': {'Model': 'Seq2Seq', 'Dataset': 'Test', 'Evaluation': 'Automatic'}, 'measures': ['BLEU'], 'outcomes': ['14.1']}

The extracted claim captures the same information, including the model (Seq2Seq), the evaluation set (Test), the metric (BLEU), and the score (14.1). While the extracted claim uses slightly different keys ('Evaluation Set' instead of 'Dataset', and 'Evaluation Metric' instead of just 'measures'), the core information is the same.
