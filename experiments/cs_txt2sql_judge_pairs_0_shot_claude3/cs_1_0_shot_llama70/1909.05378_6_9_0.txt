After comparing the extracted claim with the ground truth claims, I can confirm that the extracted claim matches one of the ground truth claims.

<classification>yes</classification>

The extracted claim corresponds to the 10th claim in the ground truth list:
{'subject': {'Model': 'Pointer-generator', 'Dataset': 'Test', 'Evaluation': 'Automatic'}, 'measures': ['BLEU'], 'outcomes': ['15.1']}

The extracted claim contains the same essential information:
- Model: Pointer-generator
- Dataset/Evaluation Set: Test
- Measure: BLEU
- Outcome: 15.1

While the extracted claim uses slightly different terminology (e.g., "Evaluation Set" instead of "Dataset"), the core information is the same. The ground truth claim includes an additional specification about the evaluation being automatic, but this doesn't change the fundamental information conveyed by the claim.
