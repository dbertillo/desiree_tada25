To evaluate if the extracted claim matches any of the ground truth claims, I'll compare the key information:

1. The extracted claim is for SQLova with BERT-Large-Uncased on WikiSQL dataset.
2. It includes both Logical form accuracy (81.6) and Execution accuracy (87.2).
3. It doesn't specify the split (Dev or Test).

Looking at the ground truth claims, there are two that match the model and base model:

1. Dev split: Execution accuracy 87.2
2. Test split: Execution accuracy 86.2

The extracted claim's execution accuracy (87.2) matches the Dev split in the ground truth. However, the extracted claim includes additional information (logical form accuracy) and doesn't specify the split.

Given these differences:

<classification>no</classification>

While the extracted claim contains partially correct information, it doesn't exactly match any single ground truth claim due to the inclusion of both metrics and the lack of split specification. This makes it a different claim from those in the ground truth.
