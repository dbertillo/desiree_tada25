After analyzing the extracted claim and the ground truth claims, I can provide the following assessment:

<classification>no</classification>

Comments:
The extracted claim does not exactly match any of the ground truth claims. While it contains some correct information, there are a few key differences:

1. The extracted claim combines both logical form accuracy and execution accuracy into a single claim, while the ground truth separates these into distinct claims.

2. The extracted claim does not specify whether the results are for the Dev or Test split, which is an important distinction made in the ground truth claims.

3. The execution accuracy value (87.2) in the extracted claim corresponds to the Dev split in the ground truth, but this is not explicitly stated in the extracted claim.

4. The logical form accuracy (81.6) is included in the extracted claim but not present in the given ground truth claims focusing on execution accuracy.

Due to these differences, particularly the combination of metrics and lack of split specification, the extracted claim cannot be considered an exact match to any of the ground truth claims.
