After analyzing the extracted claim and the ground truth claims, I can provide the following assessment:

<classification>no</classification>

Comments:
The extracted claim does not exactly match any single claim from the ground truth. While it contains some correct information, it combines data from two separate claims in the ground truth:

1. It includes both logical form accuracy (81.6) and execution accuracy (87.2) in a single claim, whereas the ground truth separates these into distinct claims.
2. The extracted claim doesn't specify whether it's for the Dev or Test split, which is an important distinction made in the ground truth claims.
3. The closest matching ground truth claim is for SQLova with BERT-Large-Uncased on the Dev split of WikiSQL, but it only includes the execution accuracy (87.2), not both metrics.

Therefore, the extracted claim cannot be considered the same as any single ground truth claim due to these differences in structure and specificity.
