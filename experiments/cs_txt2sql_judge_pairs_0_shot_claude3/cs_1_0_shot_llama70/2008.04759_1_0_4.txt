To evaluate if the extracted claim matches any of the ground truth claims, I'll compare the key information:

1. The extracted claim is for SQLova with BERT-Large-Uncased on WikiSQL dataset.
2. It includes both Logical form accuracy (81.6) and Execution accuracy (87.2).
3. It doesn't specify the split (Dev or Test).

Looking at the ground truth claims, there are two that match the model and base model:

1. Dev split: Execution accuracy 87.2
2. Test split: Execution accuracy 86.2

The extracted claim's execution accuracy (87.2) matches the Dev split. However, it also includes the logical form accuracy, which is not present in the ground truth claims. Additionally, it doesn't specify the split.

Given these differences, I would conclude that the extracted claim is not an exact match to any of the ground truth claims.
