To evaluate if the extracted claim matches any of the ground truth claims, I'll compare the key information:

1. The extracted claim is for SQLova with BERT-Large-Uncased on WikiSQL dataset.
2. It includes both Logical form accuracy (81.6) and Execution accuracy (87.2).
3. It doesn't specify the split (Dev or Test).

Looking at the ground truth claims, there are two that match the model and base model:

1. Dev split: Execution accuracy 87.2
2. Test split: Execution accuracy 86.2

The extracted claim's execution accuracy (87.2) matches the Dev split. However, it also includes the logical form accuracy, which is not present in the ground truth claims. Additionally, it doesn't specify the split.

Given these differences, I would classify this as not being the same claim.

<classification>no</classification>

While the extracted claim contains some correct information, it combines data from different splits and includes an additional metric not present in the individual ground truth claims. This makes it a different, more aggregated claim rather than an exact match to any single ground truth claim.
