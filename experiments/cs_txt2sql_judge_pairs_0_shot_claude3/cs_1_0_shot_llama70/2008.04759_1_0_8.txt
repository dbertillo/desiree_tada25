To evaluate whether the extracted claim matches any of the ground truth claims, I'll compare the key information:

1. The extracted claim is for SQLova with BERT-Large-Uncased on WikiSQL dataset.
2. It includes both Logical form accuracy (81.6) and Execution accuracy (87.2).
3. It doesn't specify whether this is for Dev or Test split.

Looking at the ground truth claims, there are two relevant entries for SQLova with BERT-Large-Uncased:

1. Dev split: Execution accuracy 87.2
2. Test split: Execution accuracy 86.2

The extracted claim's execution accuracy (87.2) matches the Dev split in the ground truth. However, the extracted claim also includes the logical form accuracy, which is not present in the ground truth claims (they only list execution accuracy).

Given this analysis, I would say that the extracted claim is not an exact match to any single ground truth claim, but it does contain information that partially matches one of the ground truth claims.
