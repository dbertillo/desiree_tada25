To evaluate if the extracted claim matches any of the ground truth claims, I'll compare the key information:

1. Model: X-SQL + EG
2. Base Model: MT-DNN
3. Dataset: WikiSQL
4. Metric: Execution accuracy
5. Outcome: 92.3

Looking through the ground truth claims, I find a match:

{'subject': {'Model': 'X-SQL + EG', 'Base Model': 'MT-DNN', 'Dataset': 'WikiSQL', 'Split': 'Dev'}, 'measures': ['Execution accuracy'], 'outcomes': ['92.3']}

This claim matches all the key information from the extracted claim. The only difference is that the ground truth specifies the split as 'Dev', which is implied in the extracted claim by the outcome value.

Therefore, my classification is:

<classification>yes</classification>

The extracted claim and the matching ground truth claim represent the same information, so they can be considered the same claim.
