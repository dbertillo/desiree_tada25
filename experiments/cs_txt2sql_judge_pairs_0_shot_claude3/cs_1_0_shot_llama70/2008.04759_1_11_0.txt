After comparing the extracted claim with the ground truth claims, I can conclude:

<classification>yes</classification>

The extracted claim matches one of the ground truth claims. Specifically, it corresponds to the claim for the X-SQL + EG model with MT-DNN as the base model, tested on the WikiSQL dataset's Test split. The execution accuracy of 91.8% matches exactly. The extracted claim also includes the logical form accuracy (86.0%), which is present in the table but not explicitly mentioned in the ground truth claim. However, this additional information doesn't contradict the ground truth, so we can consider them the same claim.
