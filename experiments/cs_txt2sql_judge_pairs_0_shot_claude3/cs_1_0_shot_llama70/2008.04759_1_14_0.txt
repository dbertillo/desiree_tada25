After comparing the extracted claim with the ground truth claims, I can provide the following answer:

<classification>yes</classification>

The extracted claim matches one of the ground truth claims, specifically:

{'subject': {'Model': 'HydraNet + EG', 'Base Model': 'RoBERTa-Large', 'Dataset': 'WikiSQL', 'Split': 'Dev'}, 'measures': ['Execution accuracy'], 'outcomes': ['92.4']}

The extracted claim contains the same information, including the model, base model, dataset, and execution accuracy. The only difference is that the extracted claim also includes the logical form accuracy, which is additional information but doesn't contradict the ground truth claim.
