After comparing the extracted claim with the ground truth claims, I can provide the following classification:

<classification>yes</classification>

The extracted claim matches the last claim in the ground truth list. Both refer to the HydraNet + EG model with RoBERTa-Large as the base model, on the WikiSQL dataset. The execution accuracy of 92.2% is also consistent. The only difference is that the extracted claim includes logical form accuracy (86.5%) which is not present in the ground truth claim, but this additional information doesn't negate the match.
