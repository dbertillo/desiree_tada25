After analyzing the extracted claim and the ground truth claims, I can conclude that:

<classification>no</classification>

The extracted claim is not exactly the same as any of the ground truth claims. While it does contain some correct information, there are a few key differences:

1. The extracted claim combines both logical form accuracy and execution accuracy into a single claim, while the ground truth separates these into distinct claims.

2. The extracted claim doesn't specify whether the results are for the Dev or Test split, whereas the ground truth claims make this distinction clear.

3. The execution accuracy value (86.2) in the extracted claim matches the Test split result in the ground truth, but the logical form accuracy (80.7) is also included, which is not present in any single ground truth claim.

These differences make the extracted claim not an exact match to any of the ground truth claims, even though it contains some correct information.
