To evaluate if the extracted claim matches any of the ground truth claims, I'll compare the key information:

1. The extracted claim is for SQLova with BERT-Large-Uncased on WikiSQL dataset.
2. It includes both Logical form accuracy (80.7) and Execution accuracy (86.2).
3. It doesn't specify the split (Dev or Test).

Looking at the ground truth claims, there are two that match the model and base model:

1. Dev split: Execution accuracy 87.2
2. Test split: Execution accuracy 86.2

The extracted claim's execution accuracy (86.2) matches the Test split ground truth claim. However, the extracted claim includes additional information (Logical form accuracy) and doesn't specify the split.

Given these differences, I would classify this as not being the same claim.

<classification>no</classification>

While the extracted claim contains correct information, it combines data from multiple ground truth claims and lacks the specific split information, making it not an exact match to any single ground truth claim.
