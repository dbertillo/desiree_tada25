After analyzing the extracted claim and the ground truth claims, I can provide the following assessment:

<classification>yes</classification>

The extracted claim matches one of the ground truth claims. Specifically, it corresponds to the third claim in the ground truth list:

{'subject': {'Model': 'X-SQL', 'Base Model': 'MT-DNN', 'Dataset': 'WikiSQL', 'Split': 'Dev'}, 'measures': ['Execution accuracy'], 'outcomes': ['89.5']}

The extracted claim contains the same information, including the Model (X-SQL), Base Model (MT-DNN), Dataset (WikiSQL), and the Execution accuracy (89.5). The only difference is that the extracted claim also includes the Logical form accuracy (83.8), which is additional information not present in the ground truth claim. However, this doesn't change the core information of the claim, so it can be considered the same claim.
