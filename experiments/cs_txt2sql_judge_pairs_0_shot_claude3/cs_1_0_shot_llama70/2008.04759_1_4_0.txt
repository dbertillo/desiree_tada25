After comparing the extracted claim with the ground truth claims, I can conclude:

<classification>yes</classification>

The extracted claim matches one of the ground truth claims. Specifically, it corresponds to the claim:

{'subject': {'Model': 'HydraNet', 'Base Model': 'BERT-Large-Uncased', 'Dataset': 'WikiSQL', 'Split': 'Dev'}, 'measures': ['Execution accuracy'], 'outcomes': ['88.9']}

The extracted claim correctly identifies the Model (HydraNet), Base Model (BERT-Large-Uncased), Dataset (WikiSQL), and the Execution accuracy (88.9). The only difference is that the extracted claim includes both Logical form accuracy and Execution accuracy, while the ground truth claim only mentions Execution accuracy. However, the information provided is essentially the same, so we can consider these claims to be equivalent.
