After comparing the extracted claim with the ground truth claims, I can conclude:

<classification>yes</classification>

The extracted claim matches one of the ground truth claims. Specifically, it corresponds to the claim:

{'subject': {'Model': 'HydraNet', 'Base Model': 'RoBERTa-Large', 'Dataset': 'WikiSQL', 'Split': 'Dev'}, 'measures': ['Execution accuracy'], 'outcomes': ['89.1']}

The extracted claim correctly identifies the Model (HydraNet), Base Model (RoBERTa-Large), Dataset (WikiSQL), and the Execution accuracy (89.1). The only difference is that the extracted claim also includes the Logical form accuracy (83.6), which is additional information not present in the ground truth claim. However, this doesn't change the core information of the claim, so it can be considered the same claim.
