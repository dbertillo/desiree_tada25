After comparing the extracted claim with the ground truth claims, I can provide the following classification:

<classification>yes</classification>

The extracted claim matches one of the ground truth claims. Specifically, it corresponds to the claim for HydraNet with RoBERTa-Large base model on the WikiSQL dataset for the Test split. The execution accuracy of 89.2% matches exactly. The extracted claim also includes the logical form accuracy (83.8%), which is present in the table but not explicitly mentioned in the ground truth claim. However, this additional information doesn't change the core of the claim, so it can still be considered the same claim.
