To evaluate if the extracted claim matches any of the ground truth claims, I'll compare the key information:

The extracted claim is for:
- Model: SQLova + EG
- Base Model: BERT-Large-Uncased
- Dataset: WikiSQL
- Metric: Execution accuracy
- Outcome: 90.2

Looking at the ground truth claims, there is one that matches these criteria:

{'subject': {'Model': 'SQLova + EG', 'Base Model': 'BERT-Large-Uncased', 'Dataset': 'WikiSQL', 'Split': 'Dev'}, 'measures': ['Execution accuracy'], 'outcomes': ['90.2']}

This ground truth claim matches the extracted claim in all key aspects, including the model, base model, dataset, metric, and outcome value. The only difference is that the ground truth specifies the split as 'Dev', which is implied in the extracted claim by the outcome value.

Therefore, I would classify these as the same claim.

<classification>yes</classification>
