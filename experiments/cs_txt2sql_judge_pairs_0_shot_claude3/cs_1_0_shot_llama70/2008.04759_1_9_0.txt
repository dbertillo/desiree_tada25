After comparing the extracted claim with the ground truth claims, I can provide the following assessment:

<classification>yes</classification>

The extracted claim matches one of the ground truth claims. Specifically, it corresponds to the claim:

{'subject': {'Model': 'SQLova + EG', 'Base Model': 'BERT-Large-Uncased', 'Dataset': 'WikiSQL', 'Split': 'Test'}, 'measures': ['Execution accuracy'], 'outcomes': ['89.6']}

The extracted claim correctly identifies the Model, Base Model, Dataset, and Execution accuracy outcome. While the extracted claim includes both Logical form accuracy and Execution accuracy in its measures, the outcome value for Execution accuracy (89.6) matches the ground truth. The only difference is that the extracted claim doesn't specify the 'Split' as 'Test', but this information can be inferred from the context and the matching outcome value.
