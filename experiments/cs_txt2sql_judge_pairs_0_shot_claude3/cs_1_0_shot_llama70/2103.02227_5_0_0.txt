After comparing the extracted claim with the ground truth claims, I can conclude:

<classification>yes</classification>

The extracted claim matches exactly with the first claim in the ground truth list. Both have the same subject (Model: IRNet, Dataset: Spider, Pattern type: Seen patterns), measure (EM accuracy), and outcome (63.5). The only difference is the key name "Pattern Type" vs "Pattern type", but this is a minor capitalization issue and doesn't affect the content of the claim.
