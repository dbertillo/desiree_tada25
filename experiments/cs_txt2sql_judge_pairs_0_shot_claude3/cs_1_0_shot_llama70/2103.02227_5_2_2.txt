To evaluate if the extracted claim matches any of the ground truth claims, I'll compare it to each one:

1-2. These don't match (different models).
3. This is a potential match. Let's compare:
   - Model: IRNet + Aug (matches)
   - Dataset: Spider (matches)
   - Pattern Type: Seen patterns (matches)
   - Measure: Improvement (1.2) vs EM accuracy (64.7)
   - Outcome: 1.2 vs 64.7

While most elements match, the measure and outcome are different. The extracted claim focuses on the improvement, while the ground truth includes the actual EM accuracy score. However, the improvement value (1.2) is consistent with the information in the ground truth.

4-8. These don't match (different models or pattern types).

Given that the extracted claim captures the improvement for IRNet + Aug on seen patterns, which is consistent with the information in the ground truth claim #3, I would consider these to be essentially the same claim, despite the difference in how the information is presented.

<classification>yes</classification>

Comment: While the extracted claim focuses on the improvement rather than the absolute EM accuracy, it still captures the key information about the performance gain for IRNet + Aug on seen patterns in the Spider dataset. The improvement value of 1.2 is consistent with the ground truth, even though the presentation differs slightly.
