To evaluate if the extracted claim matches any of the ground truth claims, I'll compare it to each one:

1-3. These claims don't match the extracted claim (different models or pattern types).

4. This claim matches the extracted claim:
   - Model: IRNet + Aug
   - Dataset: Spider
   - Pattern type: Unseen patterns
   - Measure: EM accuracy
   - Outcome: 53.7

5-8. These claims don't match the extracted claim (different models).

The extracted claim matches the 4th ground truth claim.
