To evaluate if the extracted claim matches any of the ground truth claims, I'll compare it to each one:

1-3. These don't match the extracted claim's model or pattern type.

4. This one matches the model (IRNet + Aug), dataset (Spider), and pattern type (Unseen patterns). It also has the same improvement value (4.9). However, the extracted claim is missing the EM accuracy measure and its corresponding outcome (53.7).

5-8. These don't match the extracted claim's model.

While the extracted claim partially matches ground truth claim #4, it's missing key information (the EM accuracy measure and its value). Therefore, I would classify this as not being the same claim.

<classification>no</classification>

The extracted claim focuses only on the improvement value without including the actual EM accuracy measure and result, which are important parts of the complete claim as represented in the ground truth.
