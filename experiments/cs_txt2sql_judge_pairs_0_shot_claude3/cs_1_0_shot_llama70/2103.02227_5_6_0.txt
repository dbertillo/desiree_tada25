Comparing the extracted claim to the ground truth claims, I can see that it matches exactly with one of the ground truth claims:

{'subject': {'Model': 'RATSQL', 'Dataset': 'Spider', 'Pattern type': 'Seen patterns'}, 'measures': ['EM accuracy'], 'outcomes': ['66.6']}

The extracted claim and this ground truth claim have the same model (RATSQL), dataset (Spider), pattern type (Seen patterns), measure (EM accuracy), and outcome (66.6).

Therefore, my classification is:

<classification>yes</classification>

The only minor difference is that the extracted claim uses "Pattern Type" while the ground truth uses "Pattern type", but this capitalization difference is negligible for the purpose of determining if the claims are the same.
