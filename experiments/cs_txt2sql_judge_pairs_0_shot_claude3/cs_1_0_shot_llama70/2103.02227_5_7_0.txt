After comparing the extracted claim with the ground truth claims, I can provide the following classification:

<classification>yes</classification>

The extracted claim matches the 7th claim in the ground truth list. Both claims refer to the RATSQL + Aug model on the Spider dataset for seen patterns, with an EM accuracy of 73.0. The only difference is that the ground truth claim includes the improvement value of 6.4, which is not present in the extracted claim. However, since the core information (model, dataset, pattern type, measure, and outcome) is the same, we can consider these claims to be equivalent.
