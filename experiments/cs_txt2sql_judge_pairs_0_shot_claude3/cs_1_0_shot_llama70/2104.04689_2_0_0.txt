After comparing the extracted claim with the ground truth claims, I can provide the following assessment:

<classification>yes</classification>

The extracted claim matches the first claim in the ground truth list. Both claims refer to the R-GCN approach by Kelkar et al. (2020), with a Match Accuracy of 70.4% for the Easy hardness level. The only difference is that the ground truth claim explicitly mentions the "development set", which is implied in the context of the table. This minor difference doesn't change the core information conveyed by the claim, so they can be considered the same.
