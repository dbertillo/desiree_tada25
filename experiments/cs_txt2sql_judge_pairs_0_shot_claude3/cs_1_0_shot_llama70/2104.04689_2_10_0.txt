After comparing the extracted claim with the ground truth claims, I can provide the following answer:

<classification>yes</classification>

The extracted claim matches one of the ground truth claims. Specifically, it corresponds to the claim:

{'subject': {'Approaches': 'RATSQL', 'Implementation': 'Custom', 'Dataset': 'development set', 'Hardness Level': 'Medium'}, 'measures': ['Match Accuracy'], 'outcomes': ['74.9']}

The extracted claim correctly captures the approach (RATSQL), the implementation detail (implemented by "us", which corresponds to "Custom" in the ground truth), the hardness level (Medium), and the match accuracy (74.9%). The only minor difference is that the extracted claim doesn't explicitly mention the dataset, but this can be inferred from the context provided in the table caption.
