After comparing the extracted claim with the ground truth claims, I can provide the following classification:

<classification>yes</classification>

The extracted claim matches with one of the ground truth claims. Specifically, it corresponds to the claim:

{'subject': {'Approaches': 'R-GCN', 'Implementation': 'Custom', 'Dataset': 'development set', 'Hardness Level': 'Hard'}, 'measures': ['Match Accuracy'], 'outcomes': ['46.6']}

The extracted claim correctly identifies the approach (R-GCN), the implementation (by "us", which corresponds to "Custom" in the ground truth), the hardness level (Hard), and the match accuracy (46.6%). The only minor difference is that the extracted claim doesn't explicitly mention the dataset, but this can be inferred from the context provided in the table caption.
