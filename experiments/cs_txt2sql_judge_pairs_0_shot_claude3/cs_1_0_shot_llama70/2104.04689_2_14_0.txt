After comparing the extracted claim with the ground truth claims, I can confirm that the extracted claim matches one of the ground truth claims.

<classification>yes</classification>

The extracted claim corresponds to the ground truth claim for R-GCN+RAT at the Hard difficulty level on the development set, with a Match Accuracy of 56.3%. The only difference is that the extracted claim doesn't explicitly mention the "Dataset" as "development set", but this can be inferred from the context provided in the table caption.
