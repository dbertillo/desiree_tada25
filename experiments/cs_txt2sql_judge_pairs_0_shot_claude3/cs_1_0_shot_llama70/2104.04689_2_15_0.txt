After comparing the extracted claim with the ground truth claims, I can provide the following answer:

<classification>yes</classification>

The extracted claim matches one of the ground truth claims. Specifically, it corresponds to the claim for the GPNN approach at the Hard hardness level on the development set, with a Match Accuracy of 59.2%. The extracted claim contains the same essential information as the corresponding ground truth claim, although it lacks some context details like the dataset specification. However, the core information (approach, hardness level, measure, and outcome) is consistent.
