After comparing the extracted claim with the ground truth claims, I can provide the following classification:

<classification>yes</classification>

The extracted claim matches one of the ground truth claims. Specifically, it corresponds to the claim for R-GCN (Kelkar et al. 2020) at the Extra Hard hardness level on the development set, with a Match Accuracy of 28.2%. The information in the extracted claim is consistent with the corresponding ground truth claim, although the ground truth claim includes additional context (Dataset: 'development set') that is implied but not explicitly stated in the extracted claim.
