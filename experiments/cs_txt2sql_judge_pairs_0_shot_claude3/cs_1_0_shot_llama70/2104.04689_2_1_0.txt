After comparing the extracted claim with the ground truth claims, I can conclude:

<classification>yes</classification>

The extracted claim corresponds to the ground truth claim:
{'subject': {'Approaches': 'R-GCN', 'Implementation': 'Custom', 'Dataset': 'development set', 'Hardness Level': 'Easy'}, 'measures': ['Match Accuracy'], 'outcomes': ['78.9']}

The extracted claim captures the same information as this ground truth claim. Both refer to the R-GCN approach implemented by the authors ("us" in the extracted claim, "Custom" in the ground truth), for the Easy hardness level, with a Match Accuracy of 78.9% on the development set.
