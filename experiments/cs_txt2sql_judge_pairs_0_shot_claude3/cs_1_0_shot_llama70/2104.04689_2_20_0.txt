After comparing the extracted claim with the ground truth claims, I can confirm that the extracted claim matches one of the ground truth claims.

<classification>yes</classification>

The extracted claim corresponds to the ground truth claim:
{'subject': {'Approaches': 'R-GCN+RAT', 'Dataset': 'development set', 'Hardness Level': 'Extra Hard'}, 'measures': ['Match Accuracy'], 'outcomes': ['32.7']}

The extracted claim correctly identifies the approach (R-GCN+RAT), the hardness level (Extra Hard), and the match accuracy (32.7%). While the extracted claim doesn't explicitly mention the dataset, this information is implied from the context provided in the table caption, which states that the results are for the development set.
