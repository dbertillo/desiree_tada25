After comparing the extracted claim with the ground truth claims, I can provide the following answer:

<classification>yes</classification>

The extracted claim matches one of the ground truth claims. Specifically, it corresponds to the claim for the GPNN approach at the Extra Hard hardness level on the development set, with a Match Accuracy of 41.6%. The information in the extracted claim is consistent with the corresponding ground truth claim, although the ground truth claim includes additional context (Dataset: 'development set') that is implied but not explicitly stated in the extracted claim.
