After comparing the extracted claim with the ground truth claims, I can provide the following answer:

<classification>yes</classification>

The extracted claim matches one of the ground truth claims. Specifically, it corresponds to the claim:

{'subject': {'Approaches': 'RATSQL', 'Implementation': 'Custom', 'Dataset': 'development set', 'Hardness Level': 'Extra Hard'}, 'measures': ['Match Accuracy'], 'outcomes': ['46.4']}

The extracted claim captures the same information:
- The approach is RATSQL
- It's implemented by "us" (which corresponds to "Custom" implementation in the ground truth)
- The hardness level is "Extra Hard"
- The match accuracy is 46.4%

While the extracted claim doesn't explicitly mention the "development set", this information is implied from the context provided in the table caption. The measure and outcome are also consistent between the extracted claim and the ground truth.
