After comparing the extracted claim with the ground truth claims, I can confirm that the extracted claim matches one of the ground truth claims.

<classification>yes</classification>

The extracted claim corresponds to the ground truth claim for ShadowGNN at the Extra Hard hardness level on the development set, with a Match Accuracy of 45.8%. The only difference is that the extracted claim doesn't explicitly mention the dataset, but this can be inferred from the context provided in the table caption.
