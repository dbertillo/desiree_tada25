After comparing the extracted claim with the ground truth claims, I can confirm that the extracted claim matches one of the ground truth claims.

<classification>yes</classification>

The extracted claim corresponds to the ground truth claim for the R-GCN+RAT approach with the "All" hardness level. Both claims have the same approach (R-GCN+RAT), hardness level (All), and match accuracy (65.6%). The only difference is that the ground truth claim explicitly mentions the dataset as "development set", which is implied in the context for all claims in the table.
