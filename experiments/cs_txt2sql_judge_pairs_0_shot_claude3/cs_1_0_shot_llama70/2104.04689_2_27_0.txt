After comparing the extracted claim with the ground truth claims, I can provide the following answer:

<classification>yes</classification>

The extracted claim matches one of the ground truth claims. Specifically, it corresponds to the claim for the GPNN approach at the "All" hardness level, with a match accuracy of 69.9%. The information in the extracted claim is consistent with the corresponding ground truth claim, although the ground truth claim includes additional context (Dataset: 'development set') that is not present in the extracted claim. However, this additional information can be inferred from the table caption and doesn't change the core information of the claim.
