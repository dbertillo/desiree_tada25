After comparing the extracted claim with the ground truth claims, I can confirm that the extracted claim matches one of the ground truth claims. Specifically, it corresponds to the claim for RATSQL with custom implementation on the development set for the "All" hardness level.

<classification>yes</classification>

The extracted claim correctly captures the approach (RATSQL), the fact that it was implemented by the authors ("us"), the hardness level (All), and the match accuracy (70.2%). This aligns perfectly with the corresponding ground truth claim, which has the same information.
