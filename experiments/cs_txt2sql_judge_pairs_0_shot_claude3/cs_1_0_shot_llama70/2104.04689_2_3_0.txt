After comparing the extracted claim with the ground truth claims, I can provide the following answer:

<classification>yes</classification>

The extracted claim matches one of the ground truth claims. Specifically, it corresponds to the claim for the GPNN approach at the Easy hardness level on the development set, with a Match Accuracy of 87.5%. The extracted claim contains the same essential information as the corresponding ground truth claim, although it lacks some additional context (like "Dataset: development set") that is present in the ground truth. However, this additional context is implied from the table caption and can be considered as part of the overall context rather than a crucial difference between the claims.
