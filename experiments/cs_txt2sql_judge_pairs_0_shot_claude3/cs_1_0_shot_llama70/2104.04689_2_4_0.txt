After comparing the extracted claim with the ground truth claims, I can confirm that the extracted claim matches one of the ground truth claims.

<classification>yes</classification>

The extracted claim corresponds to the ground truth claim:
{'subject': {'Approaches': 'RATSQL', 'Implementation': 'Custom', 'Dataset': 'development set', 'Hardness Level': 'Easy'}, 'measures': ['Match Accuracy'], 'outcomes': ['87.1']}

The key information matches:
1. The approach is RATSQL
2. It's implemented by the authors ("us" in extracted, "Custom" in ground truth)
3. The hardness level is Easy
4. The match accuracy is 87.1%

The only difference is that the ground truth includes 'Dataset': 'development set', which is implied in the context but not explicitly stated in the extracted claim. This minor difference doesn't change the core information of the claim.
