After comparing the extracted claim with the ground truth claims, I can conclude:

<classification>yes</classification>

The extracted claim matches one of the ground truth claims. Specifically, it corresponds to the claim:

{'subject': {'Approaches': 'ShadowGNN', 'Dataset': 'development set', 'Hardness Level': 'Easy'}, 'measures': ['Match Accuracy'], 'outcomes': ['87.5']}

The extracted claim correctly captures the approach (ShadowGNN), the hardness level (Easy), and the match accuracy (87.5%). While the extracted claim doesn't explicitly mention the dataset, this information can be inferred from the context provided in the table caption, which states that the results are for the development set.
