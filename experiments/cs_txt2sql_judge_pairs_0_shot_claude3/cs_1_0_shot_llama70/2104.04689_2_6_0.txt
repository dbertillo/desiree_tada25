After comparing the extracted claim with the ground truth claims, I can provide the following classification:

<classification>yes</classification>

The extracted claim matches one of the ground truth claims. Specifically, it corresponds to the second claim in the ground truth list, which has the following details:
- Approach: R-GCN
- Citation: Kelkar etal. (2020)
- Dataset: development set (implied from the context)
- Hardness Level: Medium
- Match Accuracy: 54.1%

The extracted claim contains the same information, although it doesn't explicitly mention the dataset. However, given the context provided in the table caption, it's clear that all results are for the development set.
