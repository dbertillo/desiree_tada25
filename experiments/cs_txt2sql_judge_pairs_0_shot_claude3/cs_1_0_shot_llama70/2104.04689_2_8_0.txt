After comparing the extracted claim with the ground truth claims, I can confirm that the extracted claim matches one of the ground truth claims.

<classification>yes</classification>

The extracted claim corresponds to the ground truth claim:
{'subject': {'Approaches': 'R-GCN+RAT', 'Dataset': 'development set', 'Hardness Level': 'Medium'}, 'measures': ['Match Accuracy'], 'outcomes': ['70.9']}

The extracted claim correctly captures the approach (R-GCN+RAT), the hardness level (Medium), and the match accuracy (70.9%). While the extracted claim doesn't explicitly mention the dataset, this information is implied from the context provided in the table caption. The slight difference in representation (e.g., 'Match Accuracy' vs 'Match Accuracy') doesn't change the core information conveyed.
