After comparing the extracted claim with the ground truth claims, I can provide the following answer:

<classification>yes</classification>

The extracted claim matches one of the ground truth claims. Specifically, it corresponds to the claim for the GPNN approach at the Medium hardness level on the development set, with a Match Accuracy of 74.9%. The information in the extracted claim is consistent with the corresponding ground truth claim, although the extracted claim lacks some additional context (like "Dataset: development set") that is present in the ground truth. However, the core information (approach, hardness level, metric, and outcome) is the same, so it can be considered the same claim.
