After analyzing the extracted claim and the ground truth claims, I can conclude that:

<classification>no</classification>

The extracted claim is not present in the ground truth claims. The extracted claim is for the OpenNQ dataset, while all the ground truth claims are for the OpenWikiSQL dataset. Additionally, the specific combination of model (BM25), index (Top-10), and outcome (56.76) is not present in any of the ground truth claims.
