After analyzing the extracted claim and the ground truth claims, I can conclude that:

<classification>no</classification>

The extracted claim is not present in the ground truth claims. The extracted claim is for the OpenNQ dataset, while all the ground truth claims are for the OpenWikiSQL dataset. Additionally, the specific combination of model (BM25), index (Top-10), and outcome (26.18) for tabular input is not present in the ground truth claims. The extracted claim appears to be from the data presented in Table 10 of the context, which is not reflected in the given ground truth claims.
