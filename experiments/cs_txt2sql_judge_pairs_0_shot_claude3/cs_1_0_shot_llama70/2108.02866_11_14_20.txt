After reviewing the extracted claim and the ground truth claims, I can conclude that:

<classification>no</classification>

The extracted claim is not present in the ground truth claims. The extracted claim is for the OpenNQ dataset, while all the ground truth claims are for the OpenWikiSQL dataset. Additionally, the specific combination of Top-10, Reranker, and both (hybrid) input type with a recall of 76.37 is not found in the ground truth claims.
