After analyzing the extracted claim and the ground truth claims, I can conclude that:

<classification>no</classification>

The extracted claim is not present in the ground truth claims. The extracted claim is for the OpenNQ dataset, while all the ground truth claims are for the OpenWikiSQL dataset. Additionally, the specific value (51.63) in the extracted claim does not appear in any of the ground truth claims. Therefore, this extracted claim is not the same as any of the provided ground truth claims.
