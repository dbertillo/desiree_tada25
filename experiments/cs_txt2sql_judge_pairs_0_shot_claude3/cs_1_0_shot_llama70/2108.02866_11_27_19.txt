After carefully comparing the extracted claim with the ground truth claims, I can conclude that:

<classification>no</classification>

The extracted claim is not present in the ground truth claims. The extracted claim is for the OpenNQ dataset, while all the ground truth claims are for the OpenWikiSQL dataset. Additionally, the specific combination of model (BM25), input type (tabular), and outcome (45.54) for Top-100 is not present in the ground truth claims.
