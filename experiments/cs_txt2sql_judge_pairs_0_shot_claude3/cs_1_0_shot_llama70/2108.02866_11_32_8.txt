After analyzing the extracted claim and the ground truth claims, I can conclude that:

<classification>no</classification>

The extracted claim is not present in the ground truth claims. The extracted claim is about the OpenNQ dataset, while all the ground truth claims are about the OpenWikiSQL dataset. Additionally, the specific combination of index (MAP), model (BM25), and input type (tabular) with the outcome value of 9.98 is not found in any of the ground truth claims.
