After comparing the extracted claim with the ground truth claims, I can conclude:

<classification>yes</classification>

The extracted claim corresponds to the first claim in the ground truth list. Both refer to the ALIGN_P model (with slight notation difference), on the WTQ dataset, for the Dev set, measuring Ex.Match with an outcome of 37.8. The only difference is that the ground truth includes the standard deviation, which is not present in the extracted claim. However, the core information is the same, so I consider these to be the same claim.
