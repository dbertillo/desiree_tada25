After comparing the extracted claim with the ground truth claims, I can conclude:

<classification>yes</classification>

The extracted claim matches with one of the ground truth claims. Specifically, it corresponds to the 11th claim in the ground truth list:

{'subject': {'Model': 'ALIGN', 'Dataset': 'WTQ', 'Split': 'Dev', 'Standard Deviation': '0.8'}, 'measures': ['Ex.Acc'], 'outcomes': ['61.3']}

The extracted claim and this ground truth claim share the same key information:
1. Model: ALIGN
2. Dataset: WTQ
3. Set/Split: Dev
4. Metric/Measure: Ex.Acc
5. Outcome: 61.3

The only difference is that the ground truth claim includes the standard deviation, which is not present in the extracted claim. However, this doesn't change the core information of the claim, so they can be considered the same.
