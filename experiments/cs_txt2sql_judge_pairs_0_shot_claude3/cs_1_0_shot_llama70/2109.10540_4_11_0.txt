After comparing the extracted claim with the ground truth claims, I can provide the following answer:

<classification>yes</classification>

The extracted claim matches the 12th claim in the ground truth list. Both refer to the ALIGN model on the WTQ dataset's Test set, measuring Ex.Acc with an outcome of 49.7. The only difference is that the extracted claim doesn't include the standard deviation, but the core information is the same.
