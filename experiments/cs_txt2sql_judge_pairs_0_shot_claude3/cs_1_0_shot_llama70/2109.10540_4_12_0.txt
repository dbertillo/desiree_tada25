After comparing the extracted claim with the ground truth claims, I can provide the following classification:

<classification>yes</classification>

The extracted claim matches the 13th claim in the ground truth list. Both claims refer to the ALIGN+BERT model on the WTQ dataset, for the Dev set, measuring Ex.Match with an outcome of 47.2. The only difference is that the ground truth claim includes the standard deviation (1.2), which is not present in the extracted claim. However, since the core information (model, dataset, set, metric, and outcome) is the same, we can consider these claims to be equivalent.
