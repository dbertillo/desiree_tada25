After comparing the extracted claim with the ground truth claims, I can conclude:

<classification>yes</classification>

The extracted claim matches the 14th claim in the ground truth list. Both refer to the ALIGN+BERT model on the WTQ dataset, for the Dev set, measuring Ex.Acc with a result of 66.5. The only difference is that the ground truth includes the standard deviation (1.2), which is not present in the extracted claim. However, this minor omission doesn't change the core information conveyed by the claim, so they can be considered the same.
