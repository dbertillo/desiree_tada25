After comparing the extracted claim with the ground truth claims, I can conclude:

<classification>yes</classification>

The extracted claim matches the last claim in the ground truth list. Both refer to the ALIGN+BERT model on the WTQ dataset's Test set, measuring Ex.Acc with an outcome of 54.1. The only difference is that the extracted claim doesn't include the standard deviation, but the core information is the same.
