After comparing the extracted claim with the ground truth claims, I can conclude:

<classification>yes</classification>

The extracted claim matches the third claim in the ground truth list. Both refer to the ALIGN_P model (with a slight difference in notation), on the WTQ dataset, for the Test set, measuring Ex.Acc with an outcome of 46.6. The only difference is that the ground truth claim includes the standard deviation, which is not present in the extracted claim. However, the core information is the same, so we can consider these claims to be equivalent.
