After comparing the extracted claim with the ground truth claims, I can conclude:

<classification>yes</classification>

The extracted claim matches the 7th claim in the ground truth list. Both refer to the EtA+BERT model on the WTQ dataset for the Dev set, measuring Ex.Match with an outcome of 47.6. The only difference is that the ground truth claim includes the standard deviation, which is not present in the extracted claim. However, this doesn't change the core information conveyed by the claim, so they can be considered the same.
