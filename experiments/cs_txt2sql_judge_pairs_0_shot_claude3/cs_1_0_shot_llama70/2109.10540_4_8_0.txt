After comparing the extracted claim with the ground truth claims, I can conclude:

<classification>yes</classification>

The extracted claim matches the 9th claim in the ground truth list. Both refer to the EtA+BERT model on the WTQ dataset's Test set, measuring Ex.Acc with an outcome of 53.8. The only difference is that the extracted claim uses "Set" instead of "Split", but this is a minor semantic difference that doesn't change the core information. The extracted claim is missing the Standard Deviation, but the primary information (model, dataset, set, metric, and outcome) is the same.
