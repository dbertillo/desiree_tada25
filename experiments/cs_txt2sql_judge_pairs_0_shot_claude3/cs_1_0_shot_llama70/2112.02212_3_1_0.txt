After comparing the extracted claim with the ground truth claims, I can conclude that:

<classification>yes</classification>

The extracted claim matches the second claim in the ground truth list. Both refer to the DT-Fixup method on the Spider dataset with a Medium hardness level and an accuracy of 80.9. The only difference is that the ground truth claim includes additional information about train and test sizes, which doesn't contradict the extracted claim but provides more detail.
