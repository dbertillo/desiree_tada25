After comparing the extracted claim with the ground truth claims, I can provide the following assessment:

<classification>yes</classification>

The extracted claim matches the fifth claim in the ground truth list. Both refer to the DT-Fixup method on the Spider dataset, with a hardness level of "All" and an accuracy of 75.0. The extracted claim is essentially a subset of the information provided in the corresponding ground truth claim, but it captures the key elements (method, dataset, hardness level, and accuracy) correctly.
