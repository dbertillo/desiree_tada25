After comparing the extracted claim with the ground truth claims, I can conclude:

<classification>yes</classification>

The extracted claim corresponds to the 6th claim in the ground truth list. Both refer to the '+Ours' method on the Spider dataset for the 'Easy' hardness level, with an accuracy of 92.7%. While the extracted claim doesn't include the train and test size information, the core information (method, dataset, hardness level, measure, and outcome) matches perfectly.
