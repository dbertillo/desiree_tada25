After comparing the extracted claim with the ground truth claims, I can conclude:

<classification>yes</classification>

The extracted claim matches the 7th claim in the ground truth list. Both refer to the '+Ours' method on the Spider dataset for the Medium hardness level, with an accuracy of 82.3%. The only difference is that the extracted claim doesn't include the train and test sizes, but the core information about the method, dataset, hardness level, and accuracy is the same.
