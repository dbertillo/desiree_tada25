After comparing the extracted claim with the ground truth claims, I can conclude:

<classification>yes</classification>

The extracted claim matches the 8th claim in the ground truth list. Both claims refer to the '+Ours' method on the Spider dataset for the 'Hard' difficulty level, with an accuracy of 65.5%. While the extracted claim doesn't include the train and test sizes, the core information (method, dataset, hardness level, measure, and outcome) is the same.
