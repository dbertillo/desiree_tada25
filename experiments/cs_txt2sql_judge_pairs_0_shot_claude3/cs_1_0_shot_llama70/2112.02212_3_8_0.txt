After comparing the extracted claim with the ground truth claims, I can conclude:

<classification>yes</classification>

The extracted claim matches the 9th claim in the ground truth list. Both refer to the '+Ours' method on the Spider dataset for the 'Extra' hardness level, with an accuracy of 52.4. While the extracted claim doesn't include the train and test sizes, the core information (method, dataset, hardness level, measure, and outcome) is the same.
