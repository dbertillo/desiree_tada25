After analyzing the extracted claim and the ground truth claims, I can conclude that:

<classification>yes</classification>

The extracted claim corresponds to the last claim in the ground truth list. Both claims refer to the '+Ours' method on the Spider dataset, with a hardness level of 'All' and an accuracy of 77.2%. While the extracted claim doesn't include the train and test sizes, the core information (method, dataset, hardness level, measure, and outcome) is the same. Therefore, these can be considered the same claim.
