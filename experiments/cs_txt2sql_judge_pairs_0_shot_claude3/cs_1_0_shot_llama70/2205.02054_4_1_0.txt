After comparing the extracted claim with the ground truth claims, I can conclude:

<classification>yes</classification>

The extracted claim matches the third claim in the ground truth list. Both refer to the dataset CG-SUB_D with a deviation <= 1, measuring similarity with an outcome of 92.9%. While the extracted claim has some additional details like "Token Deviation: 1" and the ground truth includes "Comparison: Spider-SS and Spider-CG" and "Sentence Type: Sub-sentences", the core information is the same, making this essentially the same claim.
