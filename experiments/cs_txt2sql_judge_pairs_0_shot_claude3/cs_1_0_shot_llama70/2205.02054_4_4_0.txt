After comparing the extracted claim with the ground truth claims, I can conclude that:

<classification>yes</classification>

The extracted claim matches the fifth claim in the ground truth list. Both refer to the dataset CG-APP_T with a deviation of <= 1 and a similarity measure of 86.0%. While the extracted claim has some additional or slightly different specifications (like 'Token Deviation': '1' instead of 'Deviation': '<=1'), the core information is the same, including the dataset, deviation, measure, and outcome.
