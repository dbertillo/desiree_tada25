After comparing the extracted claim with the ground truth claims, I can confirm that the extracted claim matches one of the ground truth claims.

<classification>yes</classification>

The extracted claim corresponds to the 7th claim in the ground truth list. Both claims have:
- Dataset: CG-APP_D
- Deviation: <= 1
- Measure: Similarity
- Outcome: 88.9%

The extracted claim has some additional information about the split algorithm being the same and specifying 1 token deviation, which is consistent with the ground truth claim's "Deviation: <=1". The ground truth claim provides some additional context about the comparison being between Spider-SS and Spider-CG and the sentence type being sub-sentences, but the core information is the same in both claims.
