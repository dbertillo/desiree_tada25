After comparing the extracted claim with the ground truth claims, I can conclude:

<classification>yes</classification>

The extracted claim matches the 6th claim in the ground truth list. Both refer to the CG-APP_T dataset with a deviation <= 2, measuring similarity with an outcome of 90.4%. While the extracted claim has some additional details like "Token Deviation: 2" and the ground truth claim specifies "Comparison: Spider-SS and Spider-CG" and "Sentence Type: Sub-sentences", the core information is the same, making these effectively the same claim.
