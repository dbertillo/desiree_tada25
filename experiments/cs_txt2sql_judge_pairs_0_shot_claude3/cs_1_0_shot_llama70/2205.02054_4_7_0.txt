After comparing the extracted claim with the ground truth claims, I can confirm that the extracted claim matches one of the ground truth claims.

<classification>yes</classification>

The extracted claim corresponds to the last ground truth claim in the list. Both refer to the dataset CG-APP_D with a deviation of <= 2 tokens, measuring similarity with an outcome of 92.6%. The extracted claim has correctly captured the essential information from the ground truth, including the dataset, deviation, measure, and outcome.
