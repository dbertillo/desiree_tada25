After analyzing the extracted claim and the ground truth claims, I can provide the following assessment:

<classification>yes</classification>

The extracted claim corresponds to the first ground truth claim in the list. Both refer to the ENG model on the Easy dataset with an accuracy of 31.8%. While the extracted claim uses slightly different labels (e.g., "Category" instead of "Model"), the core information is the same. The only notable difference is that the ground truth includes the study reference "[41]", which is present in the table caption but not in the extracted claim. However, this doesn't significantly change the main information conveyed by the claim.
