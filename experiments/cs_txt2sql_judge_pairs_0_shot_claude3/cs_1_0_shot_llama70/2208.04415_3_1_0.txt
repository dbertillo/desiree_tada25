To evaluate if the extracted claim matches any of the ground truth claims, I'll compare the key information:

Extracted claim:
- Model: Sequence to Tree, Category: HT, Language: HT, Method: C-ML
- Accuracy: 27.3%

The closest matching ground truth claim is:
{'subject': {'Model': 'HT C-ML', 'Dataset': 'Easy', 'Task': 'Sequence to Tree', 'Study': '[41]'}, 'measures': ['Accuracy'], 'outcomes': ['27.3']}

This ground truth claim matches the extracted claim in:
- Model (HT C-ML)
- Task (Sequence to Tree)
- Accuracy (27.3%)

The extracted claim is missing the Dataset information (Easy) and the Study reference ([41]), but otherwise contains the same core information.

<classification>yes</classification>

While there are some differences in how the information is structured and labeled, the essential experimental result (27.3% accuracy for HT C-ML on the Sequence to Tree task) is captured in both claims, so I've classified them as the same.
