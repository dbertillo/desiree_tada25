To evaluate if the extracted claim matches any of the ground truth claims, I'll compare the key information:

Extracted claim:
- Model: Sequence to Tree
- Category/Language: MT
- Method: C-ML
- Accuracy: 18.1%

The closest matching ground truth claim is:

{'subject': {'Model': 'MT C-ML', 'Dataset': 'Easy', 'Task': 'Sequence to Tree', 'Study': '[41]'}, 'measures': ['Accuracy'], 'outcomes': ['18.1']}

This ground truth claim matches the extracted claim in:
- Model (MT C-ML corresponds to the extracted Category/Language: MT and Method: C-ML)
- Task (Sequence to Tree)
- Accuracy value (18.1%)

The only difference is that the ground truth specifies this is for the 'Easy' dataset, which is not mentioned in the extracted claim.

Given that the key information matches, including the specific accuracy value, I would consider these to be the same claim, despite the minor difference in dataset specification.
