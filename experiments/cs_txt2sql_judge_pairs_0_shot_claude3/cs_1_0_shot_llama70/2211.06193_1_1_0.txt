After comparing the extracted claim with the ground truth claims, I can confirm that the extracted claim matches one of the ground truth claims. Specifically, it corresponds to the second claim in the ground truth list, which has the 'Error Analysis Category' of 'False Negatives' with a percentage of 22.4%.

The extracted claim accurately captures the model (T5+3B), decoding method (constrained decoding), dataset (Spider dev), failure category (False Negatives), and the corresponding percentage (22.4%). While there are slight differences in naming conventions (e.g., 'Failure Category' vs 'Error Analysis Category'), the core information is the same.
