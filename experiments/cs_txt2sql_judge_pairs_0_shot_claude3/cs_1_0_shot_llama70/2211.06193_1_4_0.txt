After comparing the extracted claim with the ground truth claims, I can confirm that the extracted claim matches one of the ground truth claims.

<classification>yes</classification>

The extracted claim corresponds to the fifth claim in the ground truth list. Both claims share the same information:
- Model: T5+3B
- Decoding method: constrained decoding
- Dataset: Spider dev
- Error Analysis Category / Failure Category: DK - Incorrect AGG
- Measure: Percentage
- Outcome: 17.2%

The only minor difference is in the naming of the "Decoding" field (extracted) vs "Decoding Method" (ground truth), but the content is identical. This small variation does not change the core information conveyed by the claim.
