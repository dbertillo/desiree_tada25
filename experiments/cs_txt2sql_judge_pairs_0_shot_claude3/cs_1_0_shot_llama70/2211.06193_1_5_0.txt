After comparing the extracted claim with the ground truth claims, I can confirm that the extracted claim matches one of the ground truth claims. Specifically, it matches the claim with the 'Error Analysis Category' of 'DK - Incorrect Table'.

<classification>yes</classification>

The extracted claim correctly captures the model (T5+3B), decoding method (constrained decoding), dataset (Spider dev), failure category (DK - Incorrect Table), and the corresponding percentage (3.8%). This aligns perfectly with the sixth claim in the ground truth list.
