After comparing the extracted claim with the ground truth claims, I can confirm that the extracted claim matches one of the ground truth claims. Specifically, it matches the claim for the "DK - Incorrect Column" error category.

<classification>yes</classification>

The extracted claim correctly captures the model (T5+3B), decoding method (constrained decoding), dataset (Spider dev), error category (DK - Incorrect Column), and the corresponding percentage (13.4%). This information aligns perfectly with one of the ground truth claims, indicating that it is indeed the same claim.
