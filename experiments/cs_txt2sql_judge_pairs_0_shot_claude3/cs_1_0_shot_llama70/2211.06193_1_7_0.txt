After comparing the extracted claim with the ground truth claims, I can confirm that the extracted claim matches one of the ground truth claims.

<classification>yes</classification>

The extracted claim corresponds to the 8th claim in the ground truth list. Both claims share the same information:
- Model: T5+3B
- Decoding: constrained decoding
- Dataset: Spider dev
- Error Analysis Category/Failure Category: DK - Incorrect Value
- Measure: Percentage
- Outcome: 3.8%

The only minor difference is in the naming of the "Decoding" field (Decoding vs. Decoding Method), but the content is identical. Therefore, these claims can be considered the same.
