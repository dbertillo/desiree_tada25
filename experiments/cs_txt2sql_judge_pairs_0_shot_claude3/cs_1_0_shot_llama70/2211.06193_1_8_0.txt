After comparing the extracted claim with the ground truth claims, I can confirm that the extracted claim matches one of the ground truth claims. Specifically, it matches the last claim in the ground truth list, which has the 'Error Analysis Category' of 'DK - Complex' with a percentage of 11.0%.

<classification>yes</classification>

The extracted claim correctly captures the model (T5+3B), decoding method (constrained decoding), dataset (Spider dev), failure category (DK - Complex), and the corresponding percentage (11.0%). The only minor difference is in the naming of some fields (e.g., 'Failure Category' vs 'Error Analysis Category'), but the content and meaning are the same.
