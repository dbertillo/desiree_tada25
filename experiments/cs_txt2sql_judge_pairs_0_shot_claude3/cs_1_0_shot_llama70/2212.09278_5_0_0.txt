After comparing the extracted claim with the ground truth claims, I can conclude:

<classification>yes</classification>

The extracted claim matches the first claim in the ground truth list. Both claims refer to the EditSQL method on the SparC dev set, measuring QM accuracy for the Easy difficulty level, with a result of 68.8. The only difference is that the ground truth claim explicitly mentions "Task: 'SQL prediction'", which is implied in the context of the table and surrounding text. This minor difference doesn't change the core information conveyed by the claim.
