After comparing the extracted claim with the ground truth claims, I can confirm that the extracted claim matches one of the ground truth claims.

<classification>yes</classification>

The extracted claim corresponds to the ground truth claim for the R2SQL method on the SparC dev set, with Hard difficulty, measuring QM accuracy with an outcome of 35.2. This matches exactly with the 11th claim in the ground truth list.
