After comparing the extracted claim with the ground truth claims, I can confirm that the extracted claim matches one of the ground truth claims. Specifically, it matches the claim:

{'subject': {'Method': 'CQR-SQL', 'Dataset': 'SparC dev set', 'Task': 'SQL prediction', 'Difficulty': 'Easy'}, 'measures': ['QM accuracy'], 'outcomes': ['80.7']}

The extracted claim and this ground truth claim share the same method (CQR-SQL), dataset (SparC dev set), difficulty level (Easy), metric (QM accuracy), and outcome value (80.7). The only difference is that the ground truth claim includes a 'Task' field specifying 'SQL prediction', which is implied in the context but not explicitly stated in the extracted claim. This minor difference does not change the core information conveyed by the claim.

Therefore, my classification is:

<classification>yes</classification>
