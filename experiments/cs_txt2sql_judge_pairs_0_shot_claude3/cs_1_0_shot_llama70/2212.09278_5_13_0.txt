After comparing the extracted claim with the ground truth claims, I can confirm that the extracted claim matches one of the ground truth claims.

<classification>yes</classification>

The extracted claim corresponds to the 14th claim in the ground truth list, which is:
{'subject': {'Method': 'CQR-SQL', 'Dataset': 'SparC dev set', 'Task': 'SQL prediction', 'Difficulty': 'Medium'}, 'measures': ['QM accuracy'], 'outcomes': ['68.3']}

The extracted claim correctly identifies the Method (CQR-SQL), Dataset (SparC dev set), Difficulty (Medium), Metric (QM accuracy), and the outcome value (68.3). The only difference is that the ground truth claim includes a 'Task' field, which is not present in the extracted claim. However, this doesn't change the core information conveyed by the claim, so they can be considered the same.
