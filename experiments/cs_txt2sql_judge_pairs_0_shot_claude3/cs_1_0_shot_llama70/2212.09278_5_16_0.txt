After comparing the extracted claim with the ground truth claims, I can confirm that the extracted claim matches one of the ground truth claims.

<classification>yes</classification>

The extracted claim corresponds to the ground truth claim:
{'subject': {'Method': 'MIGA+PICARD', 'Dataset': 'SparC dev set', 'Task': 'SQL prediction', 'Difficulty': 'Easy'}, 'measures': ['QM accuracy'], 'outcomes': ['81.8']}

The only difference is that the extracted claim doesn't explicitly mention the 'Task' as 'SQL prediction', but this can be inferred from the context provided in the table caption and surrounding text. All other details, including the method, dataset, difficulty level, measure, and outcome, are identical.
