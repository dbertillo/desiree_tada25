After comparing the extracted claim with the ground truth claims, I can confirm that the extracted claim matches one of the ground truth claims.

<classification>yes</classification>

The extracted claim corresponds to the ground truth claim:
{'subject': {'Method': 'MIGA+PICARD', 'Dataset': 'SparC dev set', 'Task': 'SQL prediction', 'Difficulty': 'Medium'}, 'measures': ['QM accuracy'], 'outcomes': ['66.7']}

The extracted claim correctly identifies the method (MIGA+PICARD), dataset (SparC dev set), difficulty level (Medium), metric (QM accuracy), and outcome (66.7). The only difference is that the extracted claim doesn't explicitly mention the task as "SQL prediction", but this can be inferred from the context and doesn't change the core information of the claim.
