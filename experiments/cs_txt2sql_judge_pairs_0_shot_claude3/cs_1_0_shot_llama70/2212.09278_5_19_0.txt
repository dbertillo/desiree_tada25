After comparing the extracted claim with the ground truth claims, I can confirm that the extracted claim matches one of the ground truth claims.

<classification>yes</classification>

The extracted claim corresponds to the last claim in the ground truth list, which is:

{'subject': {'Method': 'MIGA+PICARD', 'Dataset': 'SparC dev set', 'Task': 'SQL prediction', 'Difficulty': 'Extra'}, 'measures': ['QM accuracy'], 'outcomes': ['41.8']}

The extracted claim correctly identifies the method (MIGA+PICARD), the dataset (SparC dev set), the difficulty level (Extra), the measure (QM accuracy), and the outcome (41.8). The only difference is that the extracted claim doesn't explicitly mention the task as "SQL prediction", but this can be inferred from the context provided in the table caption and the surrounding text.
