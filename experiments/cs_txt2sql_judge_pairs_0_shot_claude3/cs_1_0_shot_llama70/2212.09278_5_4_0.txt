After comparing the extracted claim with the ground truth claims, I can provide the following classification:

<classification>yes</classification>

The extracted claim matches one of the ground truth claims. Specifically, it corresponds to the claim:

{'subject': {'Method': 'IG-SQL', 'Dataset': 'SparC dev set', 'Task': 'SQL prediction', 'Difficulty': 'Easy'}, 'measures': ['QM accuracy'], 'outcomes': ['70.9']}

The extracted claim correctly captures the method (IG-SQL), dataset (SparC dev set), difficulty level (Easy), metric (QM accuracy), and outcome (70.9). The only difference is that the ground truth claim includes 'Task': 'SQL prediction', which is implied in the context but not explicitly stated in the extracted claim. This minor difference does not change the core information conveyed by the claim.
