After comparing the extracted claim with the ground truth claims, I can confirm that the extracted claim matches one of the ground truth claims.

<classification>yes</classification>

The extracted claim corresponds to the 6th claim in the ground truth list, which is:
{'subject': {'Method': 'IG-SQL', 'Dataset': 'SparC dev set', 'Task': 'SQL prediction', 'Difficulty': 'Medium'}, 'measures': ['QM accuracy'], 'outcomes': ['45.4']}

The extracted claim correctly identifies the Method (IG-SQL), Dataset (SparC dev set), Difficulty (Medium), Metric (QM accuracy), and the outcome value (45.4). The only difference is that the ground truth claim includes a 'Task' field specifying 'SQL prediction', which is implied in the context but not explicitly stated in the extracted claim. This minor difference does not change the core information conveyed by the claim.
