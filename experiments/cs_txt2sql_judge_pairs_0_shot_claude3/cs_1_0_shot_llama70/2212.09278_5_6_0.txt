After comparing the extracted claim with the ground truth claims, I can confirm that the extracted claim matches one of the ground truth claims. Specifically, it corresponds to the claim for the IG-SQL method on the SparC dev set for SQL prediction with Hard difficulty.

<classification>yes</classification>

The extracted claim correctly captures the Method (IG-SQL), Dataset (SparC dev set), Metric (QM accuracy), Difficulty (Hard), and the outcome value (29.0). While the extracted claim doesn't explicitly mention "Task: SQL prediction", this can be inferred from the context provided in the table caption and surrounding text. The information presented in the extracted claim is consistent with the corresponding ground truth claim.
