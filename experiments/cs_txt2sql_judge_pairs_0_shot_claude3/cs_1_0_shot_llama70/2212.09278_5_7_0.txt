After comparing the extracted claim with the ground truth claims, I can provide the following classification:

<classification>yes</classification>

The extracted claim matches exactly with one of the ground truth claims. Specifically, it corresponds to the claim for the IG-SQL method on the SparC dev set, with 'Extra' difficulty, measuring QM accuracy with an outcome of 18.8. This is identical to the 8th claim in the ground truth list.
