After comparing the extracted claim with the ground truth claims, I can provide the following classification:

<classification>yes</classification>

The extracted claim matches the 9th claim in the ground truth list. Both refer to the RÂ²SQL (or R2SQL) method on the SparC dev set, measuring QM accuracy for the Easy difficulty level, with an outcome of 75.5. The only minor difference is that the ground truth claim explicitly mentions "Task: 'SQL prediction'", which is implied in the context of the table and surrounding text for the extracted claim. This small difference does not change the core information conveyed by the claim.
