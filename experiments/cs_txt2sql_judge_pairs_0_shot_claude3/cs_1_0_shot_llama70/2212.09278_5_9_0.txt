After comparing the extracted claim with the ground truth claims, I can confirm that the extracted claim matches one of the ground truth claims. Specifically, it corresponds to the claim for R2SQL (which is the same as R²SQL) on the SparC dev set for Medium difficulty SQL prediction task, with a QM accuracy of 51.5.

<classification>yes</classification>

The extracted claim correctly captures the method (R²SQL), dataset (SparC dev set), difficulty level (Medium), metric (QM accuracy), and the outcome (51.5). The only minor difference is that the ground truth includes a "Task" field specifying "SQL prediction", which is implied in the context but not explicitly stated in the extracted claim. However, this doesn't change the core information conveyed by the claim.
