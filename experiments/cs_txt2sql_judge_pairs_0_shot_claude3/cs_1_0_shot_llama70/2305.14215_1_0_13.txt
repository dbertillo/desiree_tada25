The extracted claim and the ground truth claims are not exactly the same. The extracted claim combines information from multiple ground truth claims into a single claim, which leads to some inaccuracies and missing details. Here's why:

1. The extracted claim combines the overall test-suite accuracy and execution accuracy for the Standard method on Spider Dev dataset, but it doesn't include the breakdown by difficulty levels.

2. The standard deviation in the extracted claim (4.08) is actually for the execution accuracy, not the test-suite accuracy.

3. The extracted claim is missing some important details present in the ground truth claims, such as the model used (Codex), the number of shots (8), and the breakdown of results by difficulty levels.

4. The extracted claim doesn't include the information for the Spider Realistic dataset, which is present in the ground truth claims.

Given these differences, the extracted claim cannot be considered the same as any single ground truth claim or the complete set of ground truth claims for the Standard method.
