The extracted claim and the ground truth claims do not match exactly. The extracted claim is for the QDecomp+InterCOL method on the Spider Realistic dataset, while the ground truth claims include multiple methods and datasets. However, there is a similar claim in the ground truth for QDecomp + InterCoL on Spider Realistic. Let's compare them:

Extracted claim:
- Method: QDecomp+InterCOL
- Dataset: Spider Realistic
- Test-Suite Accuracy: 56.5
- Standard Deviation: 4.19 (for Standard Execution Accuracy)
- Standard Execution Accuracy: 63.3

Similar ground truth claim:
- Method: QDecomp + InterCoL
- Dataset: Spider Realistic
- Test-suite accuracy: 58.6
- Standard deviation of Test-suite accuracy: 2.04
- Execution accuracy: 70.2
- Standard deviation of Execution accuracy: 2.54

While they are close, there are some discrepancies in the values and how the standard deviations are reported. Therefore, I would classify these as not being the same claim.
