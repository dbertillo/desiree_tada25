The extracted claim and the ground truth claims do not match exactly. Here's why:

1. The extracted claim is for the method "QDecomp+InterCOL" on the Spider Realistic dataset.
2. In the ground truth claims, there is no exact match for this method and dataset combination.
3. The closest match in the ground truth is "QDecomp + InterCoL" for Spider Realistic, but the values don't match exactly.

The extracted claim shows:
- Test-Suite Accuracy: 56.5
- Standard Execution Accuracy: 63.3
- Standard Deviation: 4.19 (it's not clear if this is for Test-Suite or Execution Accuracy)

The closest ground truth claim shows:
- Test-suite accuracy: 58.6
- Execution accuracy: 70.2
- Standard deviation of Test-suite accuracy: 2.04
- Standard deviation of Execution accuracy: 2.54

Given these differences, the extracted claim cannot be considered the same as any of the ground truth claims.
