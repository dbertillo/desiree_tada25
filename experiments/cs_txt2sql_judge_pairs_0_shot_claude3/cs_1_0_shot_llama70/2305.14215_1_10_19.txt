The extracted claim and the ground truth claims do not match exactly. The extracted claim is for the QDecomp+InterCOL method on the Spider Realistic dataset, but it contains some inconsistencies with the ground truth data. Let's compare:

1. The Test-Suite Accuracy in the extracted claim (56.5) matches the ground truth.
2. The Standard Execution Accuracy in the extracted claim (63.3) matches the ground truth.
3. However, the Standard Deviation values are different. The extracted claim shows 4.19 for both measures, while the ground truth shows 2.05 for Test-suite accuracy and 4.19 for Execution accuracy.

Given these differences, especially in the Standard Deviation values, I would classify this as not being the same claim.
