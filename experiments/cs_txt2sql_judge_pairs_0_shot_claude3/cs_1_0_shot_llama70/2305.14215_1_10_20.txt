The extracted claim and the ground truth claims do not match exactly. The extracted claim is for the QDecomp+InterCOL method on the Spider Realistic dataset, while the ground truth claims contain multiple entries for various methods and datasets. However, there is a similar entry in the ground truth for QDecomp + InterCoL on Spider Realistic, but the values don't match exactly. 

<classification>no</classification>

The closest matching ground truth claim has slightly different values:
- Test-suite accuracy: 58.6 (ground truth) vs 56.5 (extracted)
- Standard deviation: 2.04 (ground truth) vs 4.19 (extracted)
- Execution accuracy: 70.2 (ground truth) vs 63.3 (extracted)

These differences suggest that the extracted claim is not the same as any of the ground truth claims.
