The extracted claim and the ground truth claims do not match exactly. The extracted claim is for the QDecomp+InterCOL method on the Spider Realistic dataset, but it contains some inconsistencies with the ground truth data. Let's compare:

1. The Test-Suite Accuracy in the extracted claim (56.5) matches the ground truth.
2. The Standard Execution Accuracy in the extracted claim (63.3) matches the ground truth.
3. However, the Standard Deviation in the extracted claim (4.19) does not match the ground truth values for either Test-Suite Accuracy (2.05) or Execution Accuracy (4.19).

Given these discrepancies, especially in the Standard Deviation value, I would classify this as not being the same claim.
