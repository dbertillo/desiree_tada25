The extracted claim and the ground truth claims do not match exactly. Here's why:

1. The extracted claim is for the method "QDecomp+InterCOL" on the Spider Realistic dataset.
2. In the ground truth claims, there is no exact match for this method and dataset combination.
3. The closest match in the ground truth is "QDecomp + InterCoL" for Spider Realistic, but the values are slightly different.

Given these differences, my classification is:

<classification>no</classification>

The extracted claim appears to be a slight variation or misinterpretation of the data presented in the ground truth claims. The differences in method name ("QDecomp+InterCOL" vs "QDecomp + InterCoL") and the slight discrepancies in the reported values suggest that these are not the same claim.
