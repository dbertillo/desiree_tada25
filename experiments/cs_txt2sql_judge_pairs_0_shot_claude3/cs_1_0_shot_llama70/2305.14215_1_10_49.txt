The extracted claim and the ground truth claims do not match exactly. Here's why:

1. The extracted claim is for the method "QDecomp+InterCOL" on the Spider Realistic dataset.
2. In the ground truth claims, there is no exact match for this method and dataset combination.
3. The closest match in the ground truth is "QDecomp + InterCoL" for Spider Realistic, but the values don't match exactly.
4. The extracted claim has a Test-Suite Accuracy of 56.5%, while the ground truth shows 58.6%.
5. The extracted claim has a Standard Execution Accuracy of 63.3%, while the ground truth shows 70.2%.
6. The standard deviations also don't match between the extracted and ground truth claims.

Given these differences, the extracted claim cannot be considered the same as any of the ground truth claims.
