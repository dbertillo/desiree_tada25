The extracted claim and the ground truth claims do not match exactly. The extracted claim is for the QDecomp+InterCOL method on the Spider Realistic dataset, but it contains some inconsistencies with the ground truth data. Let me explain:

1. The Test-Suite Accuracy in the extracted claim (56.5) matches the ground truth for QDecomp + InterCoL on Spider Realistic.
2. However, the Standard Deviation (4.19) and Standard Execution Accuracy (63.3) in the extracted claim do not match the ground truth values for QDecomp + InterCoL on Spider Realistic, which are 2.05 and 63.3 respectively.

Given these discrepancies, the extracted claim cannot be considered the same as any single ground truth claim.
