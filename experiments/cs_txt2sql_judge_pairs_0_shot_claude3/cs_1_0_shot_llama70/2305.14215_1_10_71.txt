The extracted claim and the ground truth claims do not match exactly. The extracted claim is for the QDecomp+InterCOL method on the Spider Realistic dataset, but it contains some inconsistencies with the ground truth data. Let's compare:

1. The Test-Suite Accuracy in the extracted claim (56.5) matches the ground truth.
2. The Standard Execution Accuracy in the extracted claim (63.3) matches the ground truth.
3. However, the Standard Deviation value in the extracted claim (4.19) is actually the Standard Deviation of Execution Accuracy in the ground truth, not the Test-Suite Accuracy.
4. The extracted claim is missing the Standard Deviation of Test-Suite Accuracy (2.05 in the ground truth).

Given these discrepancies, especially the misattribution of the standard deviation value, I would classify this as not being the same claim.
