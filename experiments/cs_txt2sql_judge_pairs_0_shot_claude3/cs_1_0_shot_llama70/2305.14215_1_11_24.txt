The extracted claim and the ground truth claims are not the same. The extracted claim is for the "QDecomp+InterCOL (G3)" method, while none of the ground truth claims match this exact method name. The closest match in the ground truth is "QDecomp + InterCoL", but it doesn't include the "(G3)" designation, which likely refers to a specific example selection strategy.

Additionally, the values for test-suite accuracy and execution accuracy in the extracted claim (68.8 and 78.2 respectively) do not match any of the values for the "QDecomp + InterCoL" method in the ground truth claims.

Therefore, my classification is:

<classification>no</classification>
