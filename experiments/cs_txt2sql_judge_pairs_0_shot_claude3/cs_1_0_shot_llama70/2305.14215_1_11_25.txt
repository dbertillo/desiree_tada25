The extracted claim and the ground truth claims are not the same. Here's why:

1. The extracted claim is for the method "QDecomp+InterCOL (G3)", while none of the ground truth claims exactly match this method name.

2. The extracted claim shows overall results for Spider Dev, while the ground truth claims break down results by difficulty level (Easy, Medium, Hard, Extra Hard, Overall) for each method.

3. The extracted claim shows a Test-Suite Accuracy of 68.8 and Standard Execution Accuracy of 78.2, which don't match any single ground truth claim for the closest method "QDecomp + InterCoL + InterCoT".

4. The standard deviation in the extracted claim (1.07) is associated with the Standard Execution Accuracy, while in the ground truth claims, standard deviations are provided separately for both Test-suite accuracy and Execution accuracy.

Given these differences, the extracted claim does not correspond to any single ground truth claim.
