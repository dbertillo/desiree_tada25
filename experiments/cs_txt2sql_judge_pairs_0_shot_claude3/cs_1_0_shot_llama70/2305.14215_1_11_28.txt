The extracted claim and the ground truth claims are not the same. Here's why:

1. The extracted claim is for the method "QDecomp+InterCOL (G3)", while none of the ground truth claims exactly match this method name.

2. The extracted claim shows overall results for Spider Dev, but the ground truth claims break down results by difficulty level (Easy, Medium, Hard, Extra Hard, Overall) for each method.

3. The extracted claim shows a Test-Suite Accuracy of 68.8 and Standard Execution Accuracy of 78.2, which don't match any single ground truth claim for the closest method "QDecomp + InterCoL + InterCoT".

4. The standard deviation values in the extracted claim (1.07 for Standard Execution Accuracy) don't match the ground truth claims for any method.

Given these differences, my classification is:

<classification>no</classification>
