The extracted claim and the ground truth claims are not the same. Here's why:

1. The extracted claim is for the method "QDecomp+InterCOL (G3)", while none of the ground truth claims exactly match this method name.

2. The closest match in the ground truth is "QDecomp + InterCoL (G3)", but the values don't match exactly.

3. The extracted claim shows a Test-Suite Accuracy of 68.8 and Standard Execution Accuracy of 78.2, while the closest matching ground truth claim shows a Test-suite accuracy of 68.8 and Execution accuracy of 71.6.

4. The standard deviation values also differ between the extracted claim and the ground truth.

Given these differences, my classification is:

<classification>no</classification>
