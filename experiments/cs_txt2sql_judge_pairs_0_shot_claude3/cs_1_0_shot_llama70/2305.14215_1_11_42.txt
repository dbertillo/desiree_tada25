The extracted claim and the ground truth claims are not the same. The extracted claim refers to "QDecomp+InterCOL (G3)" method, while none of the ground truth claims exactly match this method name. The closest match in the ground truth is "QDecomp + InterCoL", but it doesn't include the "(G3)" designation.

Additionally, the extracted claim combines overall test-suite accuracy and execution accuracy for Spider Dev, while the ground truth claims separate these into distinct claims for each method and dataset.

Therefore, my classification is:

<classification>no</classification>
