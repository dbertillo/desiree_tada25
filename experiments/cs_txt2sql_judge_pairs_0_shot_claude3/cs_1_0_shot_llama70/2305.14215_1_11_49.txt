The extracted claim and the ground truth claims are not the same. The extracted claim is for the "QDecomp+InterCOL (G3)" method, while none of the ground truth claims match this exact method name. The closest match in the ground truth is "QDecomp + InterCoL", but it doesn't include the "(G3)" designation, which likely refers to a specific example selection strategy.

Additionally, the extracted claim combines overall test-suite accuracy and execution accuracy into a single claim, while the ground truth separates these into distinct claims for each method and dataset.
