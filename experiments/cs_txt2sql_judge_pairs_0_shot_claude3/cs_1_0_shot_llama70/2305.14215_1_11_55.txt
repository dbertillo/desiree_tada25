The extracted claim and the ground truth claims are not the same. Here's why:

1. The extracted claim is for the method "QDecomp+InterCOL (G3)", while none of the ground truth claims exactly match this method name.

2. The extracted claim shows overall results for Spider Dev, while the ground truth claims break down results by difficulty level (Easy, Medium, Hard, Extra Hard, Overall) for each method.

3. The extracted claim includes both Test-Suite Accuracy and Standard Execution Accuracy in a single claim, while the ground truth separates these into different claims.

4. The standard deviation values in the extracted claim don't match any of the ground truth claims for this method and dataset combination.

Given these differences, my classification is:

<classification>no</classification>
