The extracted claim and the ground truth claims are not the same. The extracted claim refers to the "QDecomp+InterCOL (G3)" method, which is not present in the ground truth claims. The closest match in the ground truth is "QDecomp + InterCoL", but it doesn't include the "(G3)" designation. Additionally, the values for test-suite accuracy and execution accuracy in the extracted claim (68.8 and 78.2 respectively) do not match any of the values in the ground truth claims for the "QDecomp + InterCoL" method.
