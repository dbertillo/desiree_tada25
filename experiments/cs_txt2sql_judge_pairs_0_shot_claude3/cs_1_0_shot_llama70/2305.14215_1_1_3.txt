The extracted claim and the ground truth claims are not exactly the same, but they are related. The extracted claim contains information about the Standard method on the Spider Realistic dataset, which is present in the ground truth claims. However, there are some differences:

1. The extracted claim combines Test-Suite Accuracy and Standard Execution Accuracy into a single claim, while the ground truth separates them.
2. The extracted claim includes the standard deviation for Test-Suite Accuracy, but associates it incorrectly with Standard Execution Accuracy.
3. The ground truth claims include additional information such as the Model (Codex) and Number of shots (8), which are not present in the extracted claim.

Given these differences, the extracted claim cannot be considered the same as any single ground truth claim.
