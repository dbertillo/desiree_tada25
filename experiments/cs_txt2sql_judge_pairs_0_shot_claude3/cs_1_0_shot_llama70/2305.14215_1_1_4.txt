The extracted claim and the ground truth claims are not exactly the same. The extracted claim contains information about the Standard method on the Spider Realistic dataset, but it combines multiple pieces of information into a single claim. The ground truth separates this information into multiple, more granular claims. However, the information in the extracted claim is present in the ground truth, just split across multiple claims.
