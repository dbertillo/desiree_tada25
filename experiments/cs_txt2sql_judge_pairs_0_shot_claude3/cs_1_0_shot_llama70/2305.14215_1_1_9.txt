The extracted claim and the ground truth claims are not exactly the same, but they are related. The extracted claim contains information about the Standard method on the Spider Realistic dataset, which is present in the ground truth claims. However, there are some differences:

1. The extracted claim combines Test-Suite Accuracy and Standard Execution Accuracy into a single claim, while the ground truth separates them.
2. The extracted claim includes the standard deviation values in the subject, while the ground truth treats them as separate measures.
3. The ground truth claims include additional information such as the Model (Codex) and Number of shots (8), which are not present in the extracted claim.

Given these differences, I would classify them as not being the same claim.
