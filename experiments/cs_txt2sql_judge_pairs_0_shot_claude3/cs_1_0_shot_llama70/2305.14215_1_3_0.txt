The extracted claim and the ground truth claims are not the same. Here's why:

1. The extracted claim is for the Chain-of-Thought method on Spider Realistic dataset.
2. The ground truth contains multiple claims for various methods and datasets.
3. While there is a matching claim in the ground truth for Chain-of-Thought on Spider Realistic, the values don't entirely match.

The closest matching ground truth claim is:

{'subject': {'Method': 'Chain-of-Thought', 'Dataset': 'Spider Realistic', 'Model': 'Codex', 'Number of shots': '8', 'Difficulty': 'Overall'}, 'measures': ['Test-suite accuracy'], 'outcomes': ['50.3']}

However, the extracted claim includes additional information about Standard Execution Accuracy and different standard deviation values, which are not present in this specific ground truth claim.

Therefore, my classification is:

<classification>no</classification>
