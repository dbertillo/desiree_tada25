The extracted claim and the ground truth claims are not exactly the same, but they are related. The extracted claim contains some of the information present in one of the ground truth claims, but it's missing some details and has a slight discrepancy in one value. Let me explain:

1. The extracted claim is about the Least-to-Most method on Spider Dev dataset, which matches one of the ground truth claims.

2. The Test-Suite Accuracy (66.0) matches between the extracted and ground truth claims.

3. The Standard Execution Accuracy (68.9) also matches.

4. However, the extracted claim has the Standard Deviation as 3.44, which in the ground truth is actually for the Standard Execution Accuracy, not the Test-Suite Accuracy.

5. The ground truth provides more detailed information, including the number of shots (8) and separate values for different difficulty levels, which are not present in the extracted claim.

Given these observations, while the extracted claim contains some correct information, it's not a perfect match to any single ground truth claim and contains a misattribution of the standard deviation value.
