The extracted claim and the ground truth claims are not exactly the same, but they are related. The extracted claim contains some of the information present in one of the ground truth claims, but it's not a perfect match. Here's why:

1. The extracted claim is for the "Least-to-Most" method on the Spider Dev dataset, which corresponds to one of the ground truth claims.

2. The Test-Suite Accuracy (66.0) and Standard Execution Accuracy (68.9) in the extracted claim match the values in the corresponding ground truth claim.

3. However, the extracted claim has some discrepancies:
   - It lists the Standard Deviation as 3.44, which is actually the Standard Deviation of Execution Accuracy in the ground truth.
   - It's missing some information present in the ground truth, such as the Model (Codex), Number of shots (8), and the Standard Deviation of Test-suite accuracy (2.48).

Given these differences, I would classify this as:

<classification>no</classification>

While the extracted claim contains some correct information, it's not a complete and accurate representation of the ground truth claim due to the missing and misattributed information.
