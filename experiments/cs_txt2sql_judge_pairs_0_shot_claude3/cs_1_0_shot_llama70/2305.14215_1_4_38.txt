The extracted claim and the ground truth claims are not exactly the same, but they are related. The extracted claim contains information that matches one of the ground truth claims, but it's missing some details and has a slight discrepancy in one value. Let's compare:

Extracted claim:
- Method: Least-to-Most
- Dataset: Spider Dev
- Test-Suite Accuracy: 66.0
- Standard Deviation: 3.44 (but this is for Execution Accuracy, not Test-Suite Accuracy)
- Standard Execution Accuracy: 68.9

Corresponding ground truth claim:
- Method: Least-to-Most
- Dataset: Spider Dev
- Model: Codex (missing in extracted)
- Number of shots: 8 (missing in extracted)
- Difficulty: Overall (missing in extracted)
- Test-suite accuracy: 66.0 (matches)
- Standard deviation of Test-suite accuracy: 2.48 (different from extracted)
- Execution accuracy: 68.9 (matches)
- Standard deviation of Execution accuracy: 3.44 (matches, but misattributed in extracted)

While the core information is similar, there are missing details and a misattribution of the standard deviation value in the extracted claim. Therefore, they cannot be considered exactly the same claim.
