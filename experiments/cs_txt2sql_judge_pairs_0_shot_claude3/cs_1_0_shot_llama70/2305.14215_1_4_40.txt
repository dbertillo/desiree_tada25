The extracted claim and the ground truth claims are not exactly the same, but they are related. The extracted claim contains information that matches one of the ground truth claims, but it's not a perfect match. Here's why:

1. The extracted claim is for the "Least-to-Most" method on the Spider Dev dataset, which corresponds to one of the ground truth claims.

2. The Test-Suite Accuracy (66.0) and Standard Execution Accuracy (68.9) in the extracted claim match the values in the corresponding ground truth claim.

3. However, the extracted claim has some differences:
   - It includes a "Standard Deviation" of 3.44, which actually corresponds to the Standard deviation of Execution accuracy in the ground truth.
   - It doesn't include the Standard deviation of Test-suite accuracy (2.48) that is present in the ground truth.
   - It doesn't specify the "Number of shots" or "Difficulty" which are present in the ground truth claims.

Given these differences, I would classify this as:

<classification>no</classification>

While the extracted claim contains some correct information, it doesn't fully capture all the details present in the ground truth claim and includes some misattributed information (standard deviation). Therefore, it cannot be considered exactly the same claim.
