The extracted claim and the ground truth claims are not exactly the same, but they are related. The extracted claim contains some of the information present in one of the ground truth claims, specifically the one for the "Least-to-Most" method on the Spider Dev dataset. However, there are some discrepancies:

1. The extracted claim combines Test-Suite Accuracy and Standard Execution Accuracy into one claim, while the ground truth separates these into different claims.
2. The extracted claim has swapped the standard deviations, attributing 3.44 to Test-Suite Accuracy and 2.48 to Standard Execution Accuracy, which is the opposite of what's in the ground truth.
3. The extracted claim is missing some information that's present in the ground truth, such as the model (Codex), number of shots (8), and difficulty levels.

Given these differences, my classification is:

<classification>no</classification>

While the extracted claim captures some of the correct information, the discrepancies in structure and some of the values mean it cannot be considered the same as the ground truth claim.
