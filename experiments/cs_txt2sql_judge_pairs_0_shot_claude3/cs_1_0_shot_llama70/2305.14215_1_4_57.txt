The extracted claim and the ground truth claims are not exactly the same, but they are related. The extracted claim contains some of the information present in one of the ground truth claims, specifically for the "Least-to-Most" method on the Spider Dev dataset. However, there are some discrepancies and missing information. Let me explain:

1. The extracted claim combines Test-Suite Accuracy and Standard Execution Accuracy into a single claim, while the ground truth separates these into different claims.
2. The extracted claim has the wrong standard deviation for the Standard Execution Accuracy (3.44 instead of 3.44).
3. The extracted claim is missing some information that is present in the ground truth, such as the Model (Codex), Number of shots (8), and difficulty levels.

Given these differences, the extracted claim cannot be considered the same as any single ground truth claim.
