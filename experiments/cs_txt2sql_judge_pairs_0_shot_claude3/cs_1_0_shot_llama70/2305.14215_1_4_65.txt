The extracted claim and the ground truth claims are not exactly the same, but they are related. The extracted claim contains some of the information present in one of the ground truth claims, but it's not a perfect match. Here's why:

1. The extracted claim is for the "Least-to-Most" method on the Spider Dev dataset, which corresponds to one of the ground truth claims.

2. The Test-Suite Accuracy (66.0) matches between the extracted claim and the ground truth.

3. However, the extracted claim has the Standard Deviation (3.44) associated with the Standard Execution Accuracy, while in the ground truth, this value (3.44) is actually the Standard Deviation of the Execution Accuracy.

4. The Standard Execution Accuracy (68.9) is correct in both the extracted and ground truth claims.

5. The extracted claim is missing some information that is present in the ground truth, such as the Model (Codex), Number of shots (8), and the breakdown by difficulty levels.

Given these differences, I would classify this as:

<classification>no</classification>

While the extracted claim contains some correct information, it's not a complete match with the ground truth claim due to the misattribution of the standard deviation and the missing details.
