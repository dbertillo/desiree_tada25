The extracted claim and the ground truth claims are not exactly the same, but they are related. The extracted claim contains some of the information present in one of the ground truth claims, but it's missing some details and has a slight discrepancy in one value. Let's compare:

Extracted claim:
- Method: Least-to-Most
- Dataset: Spider Dev
- Test-Suite Accuracy: 66.0
- Standard Deviation: 3.44 (but this is for Execution Accuracy, not Test-Suite Accuracy)
- Standard Execution Accuracy: 68.9

Corresponding ground truth claim:
- Method: Least-to-Most
- Dataset: Spider Dev
- Model: Codex (missing in extracted)
- Number of shots: 8 (missing in extracted)
- Difficulty: Overall (missing in extracted)
- Test-suite accuracy: 66.0
- Standard deviation of Test-suite accuracy: 2.48 (different from extracted)
- Execution accuracy: 68.9
- Standard deviation of Execution accuracy: 3.44

While the core information (method, dataset, overall test-suite accuracy, and execution accuracy) is the same, there are some differences and missing details. Therefore, strictly speaking, they are not the same claim.
