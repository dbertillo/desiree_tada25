The extracted claim and the ground truth claims are not exactly the same, but they are closely related. Let me explain why:

1. The extracted claim is for the "Least-to-Most (G3)" method on the Spider Dev dataset, which matches one of the ground truth claims.

2. The extracted claim includes both Test-Suite Accuracy (63.3) and Standard Execution Accuracy (73.8), which are present in the ground truth.

3. However, the extracted claim has some discrepancies:
   - It lists the Standard Deviation of 1.72 for the Standard Execution Accuracy, while in the ground truth, this is the Standard Deviation for the Test-Suite Accuracy.
   - The Standard Deviation for the Test-Suite Accuracy (1.95 in the ground truth) is missing in the extracted claim.

Given these differences, I would classify this as:

<classification>no</classification>

While the extracted claim captures some correct information, the misattribution of the standard deviation and the missing information make it not exactly the same as the ground truth claim.
