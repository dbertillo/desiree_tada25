The extracted claim and the ground truth claims are not the same. Here's why:

1. The extracted claim is for the QDecomp method on the Spider Realistic dataset.
2. The ground truth claims contain multiple entries for various methods and datasets, including QDecomp on Spider Realistic.
3. The values in the extracted claim (55.8 for Test-Suite Accuracy and 65.8 for Standard Execution Accuracy) do not match the corresponding values in the ground truth claims for QDecomp on Spider Realistic (57.1 for Test-suite accuracy and 69.2 for Execution accuracy).

Therefore, the extracted claim is not present in the ground truth claims as-is.
