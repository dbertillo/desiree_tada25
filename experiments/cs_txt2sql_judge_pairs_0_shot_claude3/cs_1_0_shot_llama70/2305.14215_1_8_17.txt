The extracted claim and the ground truth claims are not the same. The extracted claim contains information about the QDecomp method on the Spider Realistic dataset, but it doesn't match exactly with any of the ground truth claims. Here's why:

1. The Test-Suite Accuracy in the extracted claim (55.8) doesn't match the ground truth value for QDecomp on Spider Realistic (57.1).
2. The Standard Execution Accuracy in the extracted claim (65.8) doesn't match the ground truth value for QDecomp on Spider Realistic (69.2).
3. The Standard Deviation values in the extracted claim don't match the ground truth values.

Therefore, my classification is:

<classification>no</classification>
