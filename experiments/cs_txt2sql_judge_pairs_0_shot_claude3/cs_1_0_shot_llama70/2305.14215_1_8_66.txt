The extracted claim and the ground truth claims are not the same. Here's why:

1. The extracted claim is for the QDecomp method on the Spider Realistic dataset.
2. The ground truth claims contain multiple entries for various methods and datasets, including QDecomp on Spider Realistic.
3. However, the values in the extracted claim do not match exactly with any of the ground truth claims for QDecomp on Spider Realistic.

The closest matching ground truth claim for QDecomp on Spider Realistic has slightly different values:
- Test-suite accuracy: 57.1 (ground truth) vs 55.8 (extracted)
- Execution accuracy: 69.2 (ground truth) vs 65.8 (extracted)
- Standard deviation of Test-suite accuracy: 2.12 (ground truth) vs 2.29 (extracted)

Given these differences, the extracted claim cannot be considered the same as any of the ground truth claims.
