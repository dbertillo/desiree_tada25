The extracted claim and the ground truth claims do not match exactly. The extracted claim is for the QDecomp+InterCOL method on Spider Dev dataset, while the ground truth claims include multiple methods and datasets. However, there is a similar claim in the ground truth for QDecomp + InterCoL on Spider Dev. Let's compare them:

Extracted claim:
- Method: QDecomp+InterCOL
- Dataset: Spider Dev
- Test-Suite Accuracy: 68.4
- Standard Deviation: 5.82 (for Execution Accuracy)
- Standard Execution Accuracy: 69.7

Similar ground truth claim:
- Method: QDecomp + InterCoL
- Dataset: Spider Dev
- Test-suite accuracy: 68.8
- Standard deviation of Test-suite accuracy: 1.16
- Execution accuracy: 71.6
- Standard deviation of Execution accuracy: 1.07

While the method and dataset match, the specific values differ slightly. The test-suite accuracy is close (68.4 vs 68.8), but other values don't match exactly. Therefore, these are not the same claim.
