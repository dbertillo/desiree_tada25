The extracted claim and the ground truth claims are not the same. The extracted claim is about the SmBoP model and its characteristics, including its accuracy (75.1%). The ground truth claims, on the other hand, are about different models (RATSQL, UNISAR, PICARD) and their bias scores on various datasets and bias types. The information and metrics in the extracted claim do not match any of the ground truth claims.
