After analyzing the extracted claim and the ground truth claims, I can conclude that they are not the same.

<classification>no</classification>

The extracted claim is about the SmBoP model and its characteristics, including its accuracy of 75.1%. None of the ground truth claims mention SmBoP or have an accuracy measure of 75.1%. The ground truth claims are about different models (RATSQL, UNISAR, PICARD) and their bias scores on various datasets and bias types. The information and metrics in the extracted claim and ground truth claims are completely different.
