After analyzing the extracted claim and the ground truth claims, I can conclude that they are not the same.

<classification>no</classification>

The extracted claim is about the NatSQL model with a re-ranker (RR) and its accuracy, while none of the ground truth claims mention NatSQL or have an accuracy of 72.5. The ground truth claims are about different models (RATSQL, UNISAR, PICARD) and their bias scores on various datasets and bias types.
