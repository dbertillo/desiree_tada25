The extracted claim and the ground truth claims are not the same. The extracted claim is about the NatSQL model's accuracy with re-ranking (RR), while none of the ground truth claims mention NatSQL or re-ranking. The ground truth claims are about different models (RATSQL, UNISAR, PICARD) and their bias scores on various datasets and bias types. The information, metrics, and contexts are entirely different between the extracted claim and the ground truth claims.
