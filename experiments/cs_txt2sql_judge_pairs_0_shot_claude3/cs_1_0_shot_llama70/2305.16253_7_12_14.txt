After comparing the extracted claim and the ground truth claims, I can conclude that they are not the same.

<classification>no</classification>

The extracted claim is about the NatSQL model's accuracy with a Beam Hit re-ranker, while none of the ground truth claims mention NatSQL or Beam Hit. The ground truth claims are about different models (RATSQL, UNISAR, PICARD) and their bias scores on various datasets and bias types. The information and context are entirely different.
