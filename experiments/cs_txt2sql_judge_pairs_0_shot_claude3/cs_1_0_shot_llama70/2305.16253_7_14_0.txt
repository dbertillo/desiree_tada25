The extracted claim and the ground truth claims are not the same. The extracted claim is about the BRIDGE v2 model's accuracy on what appears to be the KaggleDBQA dataset, while none of the ground truth claims mention BRIDGE v2 or this dataset. The ground truth claims are all about different models (RATSQL, UNISAR, PICARD) and their bias scores on various versions of the BiaSpider dataset.
