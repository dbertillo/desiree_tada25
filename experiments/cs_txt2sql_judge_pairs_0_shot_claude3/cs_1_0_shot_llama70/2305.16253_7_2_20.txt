After carefully comparing the extracted claim and the ground truth claims, I can conclude that:

<classification>no</classification>

The extracted claim is about the SmBoP model with RR (Re-ranking) and its accuracy, while none of the ground truth claims mention SmBoP or have an accuracy of 72.2%. The ground truth claims are about different models (RATSQL, UNISAR, PICARD) and their bias scores on various datasets and bias types. Therefore, the extracted claim does not match any of the ground truth claims.
