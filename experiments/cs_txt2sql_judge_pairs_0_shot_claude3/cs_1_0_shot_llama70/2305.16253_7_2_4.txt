After reviewing the extracted claim and the ground truth claims, I can confidently say that they are not the same.

<classification>no</classification>

The extracted claim is about the SmBoP model with RR (Re-ranking) and its accuracy, while none of the ground truth claims mention SmBoP or have an accuracy of 72.2%. The ground truth claims are about different models (RATSQL, UNISAR, PICARD) and their bias scores on various datasets and bias types.
