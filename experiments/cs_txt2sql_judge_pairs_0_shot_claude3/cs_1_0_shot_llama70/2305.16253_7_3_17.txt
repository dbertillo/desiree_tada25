The extracted claim and the ground truth claims are not the same. The extracted claim is about the SmBoP model with ED + RR re-ranking, discussing its characteristics and performance. On the other hand, the ground truth claims are about different models (RATSQL, UNISAR, PICARD) evaluated on various versions of the BiaSpider dataset with different bias types. The information, metrics, and outcomes are completely different between the extracted claim and the ground truth claims.
