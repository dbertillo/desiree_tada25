The extracted claim and the ground truth claims are not the same. 

<classification>no</classification>

The extracted claim is about the SmBoP model with ED + RR re-ranker, discussing its characteristics and performance accuracy. None of the ground truth claims mention SmBoP or discuss re-ranking strategies. The ground truth claims are about different models (RATSQL, UNISAR, PICARD) and their bias scores on various datasets and bias types. The information and context are entirely different between the extracted claim and the ground truth claims.
