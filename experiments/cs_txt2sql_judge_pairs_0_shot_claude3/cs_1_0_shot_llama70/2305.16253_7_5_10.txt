After analyzing the extracted claim and the ground truth claims, I can conclude that they are not the same. Here's why:

1. The extracted claim is about the RESDSQL model with no re-ranker, showing an accuracy of 77.9%.
2. None of the ground truth claims mention RESDSQL or have an accuracy measure of 77.9%.
3. The ground truth claims are all about different models (RATSQL, UNISAR, PICARD) and their bias scores on various datasets and bias types.

Therefore, my classification is:

<classification>no</classification>

The extracted claim appears to be correctly derived from the given table, while the ground truth claims seem to be from a different study or context altogether, focusing on bias scores rather than accuracy.
