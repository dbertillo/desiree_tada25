After reviewing the extracted claim and the ground truth claims, I can confidently say that they are not the same.

<classification>no</classification>

The extracted claim is about the RESDSQL model with an accuracy of 77.9%, while none of the ground truth claims mention RESDSQL or have this specific accuracy value. The ground truth claims are all about different models (RATSQL, UNISAR, PICARD) and their bias scores on various datasets and bias types, which is entirely different from the information in the extracted claim.
