After carefully comparing the extracted claim and the ground truth claims, I can conclude:

<classification>no</classification>

The extracted claim is about the RESDSQL model with an accuracy of 77.9%, while none of the ground truth claims mention RESDSQL or have this specific accuracy value. The ground truth claims are about different models (RATSQL, UNISAR, PICARD) and measure bias scores on various datasets and bias types, which is entirely different from the extracted claim.
