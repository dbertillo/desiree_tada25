After reviewing the extracted claim and the ground truth claims, I can conclude that they are not the same. Here's why:

1. The extracted claim is about the RESDSQL model with no re-ranker, while none of the ground truth claims mention RESDSQL.
2. The extracted claim measures Accuracy, while all ground truth claims measure Bias Score.
3. The outcome value in the extracted claim (77.9) does not appear in any of the ground truth claims.
4. The ground truth claims are all about different models (RATSQL, UNISAR, PICARD) on various datasets (BiaSpider v1, v2, v3) and bias types, which are not mentioned in the extracted claim.

Therefore, my classification is:

<classification>no</classification>
