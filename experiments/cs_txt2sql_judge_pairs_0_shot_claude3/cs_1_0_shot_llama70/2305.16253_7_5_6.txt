After reviewing the extracted claim and the ground truth claims, I can conclude that they are not the same. Here's my classification:

<classification>no</classification>

The extracted claim is about the RESDSQL model's accuracy without re-ranking, while none of the ground truth claims mention RESDSQL or the specific accuracy value of 77.9%. The ground truth claims are focused on different models (RATSQL, UNISAR, PICARD) and their bias scores on various datasets and bias types, which is entirely different from the information in the extracted claim.
