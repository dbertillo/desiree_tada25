After comparing the extracted claim and the ground truth claims, I can confidently say:

<classification>no</classification>

The extracted claim is about the RESDSQL model with a re-ranker (RR) and its accuracy, while none of the ground truth claims mention RESDSQL or have an accuracy measure of 75.7. The ground truth claims are all about different models (RATSQL, UNISAR, PICARD) and their bias scores on various datasets and bias types. Therefore, these are not the same claims.
