After analyzing the extracted claim and the ground truth claims, I can conclude that they are not the same. Here's why:

1. The extracted claim is about the RESDSQL model with RR (Re-ranking) applied, while none of the ground truth claims mention RESDSQL or RR.

2. The measure in the extracted claim is "Accuracy", while all ground truth claims use "Bias Score" as their measure.

3. The outcome value in the extracted claim (75.7) does not appear in any of the ground truth claims.

4. The ground truth claims are focused on different models (RATSQL, UNISAR, PICARD) and different datasets (BiaSpider v1, v2, v3), which are not mentioned in the extracted claim.

Given these differences, my classification is:

<classification>no</classification>
