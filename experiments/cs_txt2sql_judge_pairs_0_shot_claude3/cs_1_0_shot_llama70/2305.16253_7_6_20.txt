After comparing the extracted claim and the ground truth claims, I can conclude that they are not the same. Here's why:

1. The extracted claim is about the RESDSQL model with RR (Re-ranking) applied, while none of the ground truth claims mention RESDSQL or re-ranking.

2. The measure in the extracted claim is "Accuracy" with a value of 75.7, while all the ground truth claims measure "Bias Score" with different values.

3. The ground truth claims are about different models (RATSQL, UNISAR, PICARD) on various datasets (BiaSpider v1, v2, v3) and bias types, which are not present in the extracted claim.

Given these differences, my classification is:

<classification>no</classification>
