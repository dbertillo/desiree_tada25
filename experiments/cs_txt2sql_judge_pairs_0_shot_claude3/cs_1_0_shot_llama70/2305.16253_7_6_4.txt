After reviewing the extracted claim and the ground truth claims, I can confidently say that they are not the same.

<classification>no</classification>

The extracted claim is about the RESDSQL model with a re-ranker (RR) and reports an accuracy of 75.7%. On the other hand, none of the ground truth claims mention RESDSQL or have an accuracy measure of 75.7%. The ground truth claims are all about different models (RATSQL, UNISAR, PICARD) and report bias scores for various bias types and datasets, which is entirely different from the extracted claim.
