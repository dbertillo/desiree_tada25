After analyzing the extracted claim and the ground truth claims, I can conclude that they are not the same. Here's why:

1. The extracted claim is about the RESDSQL model with ED + RR re-ranker, measuring Accuracy.
2. None of the ground truth claims mention RESDSQL or accuracy as a measure.
3. The ground truth claims are all about different models (RATSQL, UNISAR, PICARD) and measure Bias Score on various datasets and bias types.

Therefore, my classification is:

<classification>no</classification>

The extracted claim appears to be from the table in the given context, while the ground truth claims seem to be from a different source or experiment entirely.
