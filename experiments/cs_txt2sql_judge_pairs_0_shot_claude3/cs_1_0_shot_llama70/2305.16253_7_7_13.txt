After analyzing the extracted claim and the ground truth claims, I can conclude that they are not the same. Here's why:

<classification>no</classification>

The extracted claim is about the RESDSQL model with ED + RR re-ranker, measuring Accuracy at 77.8%. 

None of the ground truth claims match this information. They are all about different models (RATSQL, UNISAR, PICARD) on various datasets (BiaSpider v1, v2, v3) measuring Bias Scores, which is a different metric altogether.

The extracted claim appears to be correctly derived from the given table in the context, while the ground truth claims seem to be from a completely different experiment or study.
