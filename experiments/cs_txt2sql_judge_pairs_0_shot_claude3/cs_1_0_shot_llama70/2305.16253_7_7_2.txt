After analyzing the extracted claim and the ground truth claims, I can conclude that they are not the same. The extracted claim is about the RESDSQL model with ED + RR re-ranker, measuring accuracy. The ground truth claims are about different models (RATSQL, UNISAR, PICARD) on various datasets and bias types, measuring bias scores. They contain completely different information.
