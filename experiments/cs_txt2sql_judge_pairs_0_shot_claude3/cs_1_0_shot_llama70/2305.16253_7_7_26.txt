After comparing the extracted claim and the ground truth claims, I can conclude that they are not the same. Here's why:

1. The extracted claim is about the RESDSQL model with ED + RR re-ranker, measuring Accuracy.
2. None of the ground truth claims mention RESDSQL or ED + RR re-ranker.
3. The ground truth claims are all about different models (RATSQL, UNISAR, PICARD) and measure Bias Score, not Accuracy.
4. The datasets and evaluation contexts in the ground truth claims (BiaSpider v1, v2, v3) are different from the extracted claim.

Therefore, my classification is:

<classification>no</classification>
