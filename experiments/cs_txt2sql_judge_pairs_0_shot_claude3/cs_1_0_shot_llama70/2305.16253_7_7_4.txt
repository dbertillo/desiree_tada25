After reviewing the extracted claim and the ground truth claims, I can confidently say that they are not the same.

<classification>no</classification>

The extracted claim is about the RESDSQL model with ED + RR re-ranker, measuring Accuracy with a value of 77.8. On the other hand, none of the ground truth claims mention RESDSQL or have an accuracy measure of 77.8. The ground truth claims are all about different models (RATSQL, UNISAR, PICARD) and measure Bias Scores on various datasets and bias types. The information in the extracted claim does not match any of the ground truth claims.
