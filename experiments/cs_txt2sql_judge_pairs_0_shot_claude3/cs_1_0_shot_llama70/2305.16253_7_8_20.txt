After analyzing the extracted claim and the ground truth claims, I can conclude that they are not the same. Here's why:

1. The extracted claim is about the RESDSQL model with a Beam Hit re-ranker, measuring Accuracy at 86.6%.
2. None of the ground truth claims mention RESDSQL, Beam Hit, or have an Accuracy measure of 86.6%.
3. The ground truth claims are all about different models (RATSQL, UNISAR, PICARD) on various datasets (BiaSpider v1, v2, v3) with different bias types, measuring Bias Scores.

Therefore, my classification is:

<classification>no</classification>
