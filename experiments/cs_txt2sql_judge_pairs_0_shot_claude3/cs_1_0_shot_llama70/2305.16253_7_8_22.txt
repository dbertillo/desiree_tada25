After reviewing the extracted claim and the ground truth claims, I can confidently say that they are not the same.

<classification>no</classification>

The extracted claim is about the RESDSQL model with a Beam Hit re-ranker, reporting an accuracy of 86.6%. This information is not present in any of the ground truth claims. The ground truth claims are all about different models (RATSQL, UNISAR, PICARD) evaluated on various versions of the BiaSpider dataset, measuring bias scores for different bias types. The metrics, models, and contexts are entirely different between the extracted claim and the ground truth claims.
