After analyzing the extracted claim and the ground truth claims, I can confidently say that they are not the same.

<classification>no</classification>

The extracted claim is about the NatSQL model's accuracy without any re-ranker, while none of the ground truth claims mention NatSQL or have an accuracy of 71.3%. The ground truth claims are all about different models (RATSQL, UNISAR, PICARD) and their bias scores on various datasets and bias types, which is entirely different from the information in the extracted claim.
