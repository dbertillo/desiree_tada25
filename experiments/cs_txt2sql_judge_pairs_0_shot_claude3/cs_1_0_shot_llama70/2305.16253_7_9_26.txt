After analyzing the extracted claim and the ground truth claims, I can conclude that they are not the same. Here's why:

1. The extracted claim is about the NatSQL model with no re-ranker, while none of the ground truth claims mention NatSQL.
2. The extracted claim measures Accuracy, while all ground truth claims measure Bias Score.
3. The extracted claim's outcome (71.3) doesn't match any of the outcomes in the ground truth claims.
4. The ground truth claims are all about different models (RATSQL, UNISAR, PICARD) and different datasets (BiaSpider v1, v2, v3), which are not mentioned in the extracted claim.

Therefore, my classification is:

<classification>no</classification>
