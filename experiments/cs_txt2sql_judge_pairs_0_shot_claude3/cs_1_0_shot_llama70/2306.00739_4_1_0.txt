The extracted claim matches the first two claims in the ground truth, which correspond to the Concise prompt design with 0-shot adaptation setting. The extracted claim combines both EX and TS measures into a single claim, while the ground truth separates them into two distinct claims. However, the core information (prompt design, adaptation setting, measures, and outcomes) is the same.

While the extracted claim doesn't explicitly mention the Dataset (Spider Dev) or the Model (PaLM-2), this information can be inferred from the context provided in the table caption and the surrounding text. The extracted claim also includes some additional context about the query type and number of demonstrations, which doesn't contradict the ground truth but provides more background information.
