The extracted claim matches the third and fourth claims in the ground truth list. Both refer to the Verbose prompt design with 0-shot adaptation setting, and have the same EX and TS measures and outcomes. The extracted claim combines these two separate ground truth claims into a single claim with both measures.

<classification>yes</classification>

While the extracted claim does contain some additional information in the subject (e.g., "Query type" and "Number of demonstrations"), the core information about the prompt design, adaptation setting, method, test suite, measures, and outcomes is consistent with the ground truth claims.
