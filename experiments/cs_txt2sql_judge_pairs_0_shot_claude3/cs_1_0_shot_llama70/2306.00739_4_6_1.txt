After analyzing the extracted claim and the ground truth claims, I can provide the following assessment:

<classification>no</classification>

Comments:
The extracted claim does not directly match any of the ground truth claims. While it contains some information about the Verbose prompt design approach, it lacks specific experimental results (measures and outcomes) that are present in the ground truth claims. The extracted claim focuses more on describing the Verbose approach rather than presenting quantitative results. Additionally, the ground truth claims include more specific details such as adaptation settings, dataset used, and the specific model, which are not present in the extracted claim. Therefore, the extracted claim cannot be considered the same as any of the ground truth claims.
