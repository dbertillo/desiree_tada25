The extracted claim and the ground truth claims are not the same. While they both mention the "Concise" prompt design, the extracted claim provides a general description of what the Concise prompt design means, without any specific experimental results. On the other hand, the ground truth claims contain specific experimental results for different settings (0-shot and 4-shot) with measures (EX and TS) and their corresponding outcomes.

The extracted claim seems to be more of a general description of the Concise prompt design approach, while the ground truth claims are specific experimental results from the table.
