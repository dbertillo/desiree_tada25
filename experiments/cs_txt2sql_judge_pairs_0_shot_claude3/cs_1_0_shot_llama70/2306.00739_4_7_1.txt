After analyzing the extracted claim and the ground truth claims, I can conclude that they are not the same.

<classification>no</classification>

The extracted claim contains general information about the Concise prompt design approach, describing it as using "syntax to describe the database schema" with the advantage of "clearly presenting table structure". However, it doesn't include any specific experimental results or adaptation settings.

In contrast, the ground truth claims are more specific, containing experimental results for both Concise and Verbose prompt designs, with different adaptation settings (0-shot and 4-shot), and including specific performance metrics (EX and TS) with their corresponding outcomes. The ground truth claims also specify the dataset (Spider Dev), method (Few-shot SQL-PaLM), and model (PaLM-2) used, which are not present in the extracted claim.

While the extracted claim does capture some information about the Concise prompt design, it lacks the specific experimental details and results that are present in the ground truth claims. Therefore, they cannot be considered the same claim.
