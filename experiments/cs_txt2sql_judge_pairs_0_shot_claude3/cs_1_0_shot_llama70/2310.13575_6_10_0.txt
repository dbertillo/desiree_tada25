To evaluate whether the extracted claim is the same as any of the ground truth claims, I'll compare the key elements:

1. The extracted claim has:
   - Support: 277
   - QPL Length: 2
   - Model: Q -> QPL
   - Dataset: Spider Development Set

2. Looking through the ground truth claims, there is one that matches these specifications:
   {'subject': {'Dataset': 'Spider Development Set', 'Model': 'Q â†’ QPL', 'QPL Length': '2', 'Support': '277'}, 'measures': ['Execution Accuracy'], 'outcomes': ['86.6']}

The extracted claim matches this ground truth claim in terms of the subject specifications. However, the extracted claim is missing the 'measures' and 'outcomes' information that is present in the ground truth claim.

Given this analysis:

<classification>no</classification>

While the extracted claim captures some of the correct information, it is incomplete compared to the ground truth claim. It's missing crucial information about the execution accuracy measure and its corresponding outcome value of 86.6%. Therefore, we cannot consider these two claims to be the same.
