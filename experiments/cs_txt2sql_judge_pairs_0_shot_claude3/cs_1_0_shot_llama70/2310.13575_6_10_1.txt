To evaluate whether the extracted claim is the same as any of the ground truth claims, I'll compare it to each one:

The extracted claim matches most closely with this ground truth claim:
{'subject': {'Dataset': 'Spider Development Set', 'Model': 'Q → QPL', 'QPL Length': '2', 'Support': '277'}, 'measures': ['Execution Accuracy'], 'outcomes': ['86.6']}

They share the same 'Support' (277), 'QPL Length' (2), and 'Dataset' (Spider Development Set). The 'Model' is also the same, though represented slightly differently ('Q -> QPL' vs 'Q → QPL').

However, the extracted claim is missing the 'measures' and 'outcomes' that are present in the ground truth claim. This is a significant difference in information content.

Given this analysis:

<classification>no</classification>

While the extracted claim captures some of the same information as one of the ground truth claims, it's missing crucial experimental results (the Execution Accuracy measure and its corresponding outcome). Therefore, it cannot be considered the same claim.
