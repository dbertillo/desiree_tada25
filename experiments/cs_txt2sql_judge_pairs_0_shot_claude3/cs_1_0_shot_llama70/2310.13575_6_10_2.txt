To evaluate whether the extracted claim is the same as any of the ground truth claims, I'll compare it to each one:

The extracted claim matches most closely with this ground truth claim:
{'subject': {'Dataset': 'Spider Development Set', 'Model': 'Q → QPL', 'QPL Length': '2', 'Support': '277'}, 'measures': ['Execution Accuracy'], 'outcomes': ['86.6']}

They share the same 'Support' (277), 'QPL Length' (2), and 'Dataset' (Spider Development Set). The 'Model' is also essentially the same, with a slight difference in notation ('Q -> QPL' vs 'Q → QPL').

However, the extracted claim is missing the 'measures' and 'outcomes' that are present in the ground truth claim. This is a significant omission of information.

Given this difference:

<classification>no</classification>

While the extracted claim captures some of the correct information, it's incomplete compared to the ground truth claim, missing crucial experimental results (Execution Accuracy and its value). Therefore, they cannot be considered the same claim.
