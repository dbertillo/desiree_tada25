To evaluate whether the extracted claim is the same as any of the ground truth claims, I'll compare it to each one:

The extracted claim matches most closely with this ground truth claim:
{'subject': {'Dataset': 'Spider Development Set', 'Model': 'Q → QPL', 'QPL Length': '2', 'Support': '277'}, 'measures': ['Execution Accuracy'], 'outcomes': ['86.6']}

They share the same 'Support' (277), 'QPL Length' (2), and 'Dataset' (Spider Development Set). The 'Model' is also the same, though represented slightly differently ('Q -> QPL' vs 'Q → QPL').

However, the extracted claim is missing the 'measures' and 'outcomes' that are present in the ground truth claim. This is significant information that's not captured in the extracted version.

Given this difference:

<classification>no</classification>

While the extracted claim captures some of the same information, it's missing crucial elements (the execution accuracy measure and its value) that are present in the ground truth claim. Therefore, they cannot be considered the same claim.
