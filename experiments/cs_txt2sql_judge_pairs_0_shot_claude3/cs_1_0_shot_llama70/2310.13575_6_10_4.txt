To evaluate whether the extracted claim is the same as any of the ground truth claims, I'll compare the information in the extracted claim to each ground truth claim.

The extracted claim contains:
- Support: 277
- QPL Length: 2
- Model: Q -> QPL
- Dataset: Spider Development Set

Looking through the ground truth claims, I find one that matches these specifications:

{'subject': {'Dataset': 'Spider Development Set', 'Model': 'Q â†’ QPL', 'QPL Length': '2', 'Support': '277'}, 'measures': ['Execution Accuracy'], 'outcomes': ['86.6']}

This ground truth claim contains all the information present in the extracted claim, plus additional information about the measure (Execution Accuracy) and outcome (86.6%). 

Since the extracted claim is a subset of the information contained in this ground truth claim, and does not contradict any of the information, we can consider them to be the same claim.
