To evaluate if the extracted claim is the same as any of the ground truth claims, I'll compare the key elements:

1. The extracted claim has:
   - Support: 277
   - QPL Length: 2
   - Model: Q+QD -> QPL
   - Dataset: Spider Development Set

2. Looking at the ground truth claims, there is one that matches these criteria:
   {'subject': {'Dataset': 'Spider Development Set', 'Model': 'Q+QD â†’ QPL', 'QPL Length': '2', 'Support': '277'}, 'measures': ['Execution Accuracy'], 'outcomes': ['83.4']}

The extracted claim matches this ground truth claim in terms of the subject information. However, the extracted claim is missing the 'measures' and 'outcomes' information that is present in the ground truth claim.

Given this discrepancy:

<classification>no</classification>

While the extracted claim correctly identifies some key information, it is incomplete compared to the ground truth claim as it lacks the performance metric (Execution Accuracy) and its corresponding value (83.4%). Therefore, it cannot be considered the same claim.
