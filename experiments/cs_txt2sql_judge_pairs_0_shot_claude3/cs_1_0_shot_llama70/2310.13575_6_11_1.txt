To evaluate if the extracted claim is the same as any of the ground truth claims, I'll compare the information in each.

The extracted claim contains:
- Support: 277
- QPL Length: 2
- Model: Q+QD -> QPL
- Dataset: Spider Development Set

Looking through the ground truth claims, there is one that matches these specifications:

{'subject': {'Dataset': 'Spider Development Set', 'Model': 'Q+QD â†’ QPL', 'QPL Length': '2', 'Support': '277'}, 'measures': ['Execution Accuracy'], 'outcomes': ['83.4']}

This ground truth claim contains all the information present in the extracted claim, plus additional information about the measure (Execution Accuracy) and outcome (83.4%) that the extracted claim is missing.

Since the extracted claim contains a subset of the information in this ground truth claim and doesn't contradict it, we can consider them to be the same claim, even though the extracted one is less complete.
