After comparing the extracted claim with the ground truth claims, I can confirm that the extracted claim matches one of the ground truth claims. Specifically, it corresponds to the claim:

{'subject': {'Dataset': 'Spider Development Set', 'Model': 'Q â†’ QPL', 'QPL Length': '3', 'Support': '191'}, 'measures': ['Execution Accuracy'], 'outcomes': ['85.3']}

The extracted claim contains the same information for the QPL Length (3), Model (Q -> QPL), Dataset (Spider Development Set), measure (Execution Accuracy), and outcome (85.3%). The only difference is that the extracted claim doesn't include the 'Support' value, but this doesn't change the core information of the claim.

Therefore, my classification is:

<classification>yes</classification>
