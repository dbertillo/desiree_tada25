To evaluate if the extracted claim is the same as any of the ground truth claims, I'll compare the information in both.

The extracted claim contains:
- Support: 191
- QPL Length: 3
- Model: Q -> QPL
- Dataset: Spider Development Set

Looking at the ground truth claims, there is one that matches these specifications:

{'subject': {'Dataset': 'Spider Development Set', 'Model': 'Q â†’ QPL', 'QPL Length': '3', 'Support': '191'}, 'measures': ['Execution Accuracy'], 'outcomes': ['85.3']}

This ground truth claim contains all the information from the extracted claim, plus additional information about the measure (Execution Accuracy) and the outcome (85.3%).

While the extracted claim is missing some information compared to the ground truth, the information it does contain is correct and matches the ground truth claim. Therefore, I would consider this to be the same claim, albeit with less detail.

<classification>yes</classification>

Comment: The extracted claim is correct but incomplete. It's missing the measure (Execution Accuracy) and the outcome (85.3%). In future extractions, including these additional pieces of information would make the claim more comprehensive and valuable.
