To evaluate whether the extracted claim matches any of the ground truth claims, I'll compare the key information:

1. The extracted claim is for the Spider Development Set, which matches all ground truth claims.
2. The extracted claim mentions "Text-to-QPL" model, while ground truth claims specify either "Q → QPL" or "Q+QD → QPL".
3. The extracted claim has an Execution Accuracy of 75.0%, which matches only one ground truth claim: the "Q → QPL" model with QPL Length 4.
4. The extracted claim doesn't specify the QPL Length or Support, which are present in all ground truth claims.

Based on this analysis:

<classification>no</classification>

The extracted claim does not exactly match any single ground truth claim. While it does correspond to one specific data point (75.0% accuracy for Q → QPL with QPL Length 4), it lacks important specifics like the exact model type and QPL Length. It also generalizes "Text-to-QPL" instead of distinguishing between the two model types present in the ground truth. Therefore, it cannot be considered the same as any single ground truth claim.
