To evaluate whether the extracted claim matches any of the ground truth claims, I'll compare the key information:

1. The extracted claim is for the "Text-to-QPL" model on the Spider Development Set, using QPL Length as a measure of query complexity.
2. It reports an Execution Accuracy of 75.0%.

Looking at the ground truth claims, we can see that there is a match:

{'subject': {'Dataset': 'Spider Development Set', 'Model': 'Q → QPL', 'QPL Length': '4', 'Support': '124'}, 'measures': ['Execution Accuracy'], 'outcomes': ['75.0']}

This claim matches the extracted one in terms of the dataset (Spider Development Set), the model (Q → QPL is a Text-to-QPL model), the measure (Execution Accuracy), and the outcome (75.0%). The QPL Length of 4 is not explicitly mentioned in the extracted claim, but it corresponds to the 75.0% accuracy.

Based on this analysis:

<classification>yes</classification>

The extracted claim does match one of the ground truth claims, specifically the one for the Q → QPL model with a QPL Length of 4.
