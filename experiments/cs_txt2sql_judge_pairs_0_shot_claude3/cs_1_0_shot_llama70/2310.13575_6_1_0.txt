After analyzing the extracted claim and the ground truth claims, I can conclude that:

<classification>yes</classification>

The extracted claim corresponds to one of the ground truth claims, specifically:

{'subject': {'Dataset': 'Spider Development Set', 'Model': 'Q+QD → QPL', 'QPL Length': '1', 'Support': '189'}, 'measures': ['Execution Accuracy'], 'outcomes': ['78.3']}

The extracted claim matches this ground truth claim in terms of the dataset (Spider Development Set), the model type (Q+QD → QPL, which is a Text-to-QPL model), the measure (Execution Accuracy), and the outcome (78.3%). The QPL Length of 1 is not explicitly mentioned in the extracted claim, but it's still the same claim representing the same information from the table.
