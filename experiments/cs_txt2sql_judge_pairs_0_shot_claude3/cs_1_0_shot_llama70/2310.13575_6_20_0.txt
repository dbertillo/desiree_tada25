After comparing the extracted claim with the ground truth claims, I can confirm that the extracted claim matches one of the ground truth claims. Specifically, it corresponds to the 7th claim in the ground truth list:

{'subject': {'Dataset': 'Spider Development Set', 'Model': 'Q → QPL', 'QPL Length': '4', 'Support': '124'}, 'measures': ['Execution Accuracy'], 'outcomes': ['75.0']}

The extracted claim contains the same information:
- QPL Length: 4
- Model: Q -> QPL (which is equivalent to Q → QPL)
- Dataset: Spider Development Set
- Execution Accuracy: 75.0%

The only difference is that the extracted claim doesn't include the 'Support' value, but this doesn't change the core information of the claim.

Therefore, my classification is:

<classification>yes</classification>
