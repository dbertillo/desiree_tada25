To evaluate if the extracted claim matches any of the ground truth claims, I'll compare it to each one:

The extracted claim has:
- QPL Length: 4
- Model: Q+QD -> QPL
- Dataset: Spider Development Set
- Execution Accuracy: 62.9%

Looking through the ground truth claims, I find an exact match:

{'subject': {'Dataset': 'Spider Development Set', 'Model': 'Q+QD → QPL', 'QPL Length': '4', 'Support': '124'}, 'measures': ['Execution Accuracy'], 'outcomes': ['62.9']}

This ground truth claim matches the extracted claim in all relevant aspects:
- Same QPL Length (4)
- Same Model (Q+QD → QPL)
- Same Dataset (Spider Development Set)
- Same Execution Accuracy (62.9%)

The only difference is that the ground truth includes a 'Support' value, which is additional information not present in the extracted claim. However, this doesn't change the core information of the claim.

Therefore, my answer is:

<classification>yes</classification>

The extracted claim is indeed the same as one of the ground truth claims.
