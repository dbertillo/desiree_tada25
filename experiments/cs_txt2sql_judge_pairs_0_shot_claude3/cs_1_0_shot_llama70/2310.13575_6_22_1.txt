To evaluate if the extracted claim is the same as any of the ground truth claims, I'll compare the information in both.

The extracted claim contains:
- Support: 124
- QPL Length: 4
- Model: Q -> QPL
- Dataset: Spider Development Set

Looking through the ground truth claims, I find a match that contains the same information:

{'subject': {'Dataset': 'Spider Development Set', 'Model': 'Q â†’ QPL', 'QPL Length': '4', 'Support': '124'}, 'measures': ['Execution Accuracy'], 'outcomes': ['75.0']}

This ground truth claim matches all the information in the extracted claim. However, the extracted claim is missing the 'measures' and 'outcomes' information that is present in the ground truth claim.

Given this analysis, my classification is:

<classification>no</classification>

The extracted claim, while partially correct, is incomplete compared to the ground truth claim. It's missing crucial information about the execution accuracy measure and its corresponding outcome value.
