After analyzing the extracted claim and the ground truth claims, I can provide the following assessment:

<classification>no</classification>

The extracted claim does not fully match any of the ground truth claims. While it shares some similarities with one of the ground truth claims, there are important differences:

1. The extracted claim has the correct 'Support' (124) and 'QPL Length' (4) for the 'Q+QD → QPL' model on the Spider Development Set.

2. However, the extracted claim is missing crucial information present in the ground truth claim:
   - It doesn't include the 'Execution Accuracy' measure.
   - It's missing the corresponding outcome value (62.9%).

3. The ground truth claim that most closely matches the extracted claim is:
   {'subject': {'Dataset': 'Spider Development Set', 'Model': 'Q+QD → QPL', 'QPL Length': '4', 'Support': '124'}, 'measures': ['Execution Accuracy'], 'outcomes': ['62.9']}

While the extracted claim captures some of the context, it fails to include the key experimental result (the execution accuracy), which is an essential part of the claim. Therefore, it cannot be considered the same as any of the ground truth claims.
