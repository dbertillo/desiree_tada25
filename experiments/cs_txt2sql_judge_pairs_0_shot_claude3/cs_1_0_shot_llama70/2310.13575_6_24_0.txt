To evaluate if the extracted claim matches any of the ground truth claims, I'll compare the key information:

1. The extracted claim is for the Spider Development Set, which matches all ground truth claims.
2. The extracted claim mentions "Text-to-QPL" model, while ground truth claims specify either "Q → QPL" or "Q+QD → QPL".
3. The extracted claim has an Execution Accuracy of 67.1%, which matches only one ground truth claim.
4. The matching ground truth claim is for the "Q → QPL" model with QPL Length of 5 and Support of 164.

Based on this analysis:

<classification>yes</classification>

The extracted claim appears to be the same as one of the ground truth claims, specifically the one for the "Q → QPL" model with QPL Length 5. However, the extracted claim is less specific (it doesn't mention the QPL Length or Support) and uses a more general term for the model ("Text-to-QPL" instead of "Q → QPL").
