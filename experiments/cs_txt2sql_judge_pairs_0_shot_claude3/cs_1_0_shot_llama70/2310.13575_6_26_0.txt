After comparing the extracted claim with the ground truth claims, I can confirm that the extracted claim matches one of the ground truth claims. Specifically, it corresponds to the 9th claim in the ground truth list:

{'subject': {'Dataset': 'Spider Development Set', 'Model': 'Q â†’ QPL', 'QPL Length': '5', 'Support': '164'}, 'measures': ['Execution Accuracy'], 'outcomes': ['67.1']}

The extracted claim contains the same information, although it's missing the 'Support' value. However, since all other key information (QPL Length, Model, Dataset, measure, and outcome) matches exactly, we can consider this the same claim.
