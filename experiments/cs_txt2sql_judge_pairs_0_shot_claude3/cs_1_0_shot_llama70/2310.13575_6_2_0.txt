After comparing the extracted claim with the ground truth claims, I can confirm that the extracted claim matches one of the ground truth claims. Specifically, it corresponds to the first claim in the ground truth list.

<classification>yes</classification>

The extracted claim and the matching ground truth claim both have:
- QPL Length: 1
- Model: Q â†’ QPL (represented as "Q -> QPL" in the extracted claim)
- Dataset: Spider Development Set
- Measure: Execution Accuracy
- Outcome: 87.3% (87.3 in the ground truth)

The only difference is that the ground truth claim includes the 'Support' value of 189, which is not present in the extracted claim. However, this doesn't change the core information of the claim, so they can be considered the same.
