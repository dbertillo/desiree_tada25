To evaluate if the extracted claim matches any of the ground truth claims, I'll compare it to each one:

The extracted claim matches the second ground truth claim:

{'subject': {'Dataset': 'Spider Development Set', 'Model': 'Q+QD → QPL', 'QPL Length': '1', 'Support': '189'}, 'measures': ['Execution Accuracy'], 'outcomes': ['78.3']}

The extracted claim has:
- The same Dataset (Spider Development Set)
- The same Model (Q+QD → QPL)
- The same QPL Length (1)
- The same measure (Execution Accuracy)
- The same outcome (78.3%)

The only difference is that the extracted claim doesn't include the 'Support' value, but this doesn't change the core information of the claim.
