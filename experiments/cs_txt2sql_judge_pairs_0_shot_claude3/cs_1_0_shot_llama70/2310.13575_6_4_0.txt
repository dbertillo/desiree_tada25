To evaluate if the extracted claim is the same as any of the ground truth claims, I'll compare the information in the extracted claim to each ground truth claim.

The extracted claim contains:
- Support: 189
- QPL Length: 1
- Model: Q -> QPL
- Dataset: Spider Development Set

This matches exactly with the first ground truth claim:
{'subject': {'Dataset': 'Spider Development Set', 'Model': 'Q â†’ QPL', 'QPL Length': '1', 'Support': '189'}, 'measures': ['Execution Accuracy'], 'outcomes': ['87.3']}

However, the extracted claim is missing the 'measures' and 'outcomes' information that is present in the ground truth claim. This means that while the context is the same, the extracted claim does not contain the full information of the ground truth claim.

<classification>no</classification>

The extracted claim matches the context of one ground truth claim, but it's incomplete as it's missing the experimental results (measures and outcomes). Therefore, it cannot be considered the same claim.
