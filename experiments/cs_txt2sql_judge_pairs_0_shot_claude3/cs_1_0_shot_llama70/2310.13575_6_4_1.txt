To evaluate if the extracted claim is the same as any of the ground truth claims, I'll compare it to each one:

The extracted claim matches most closely with this ground truth claim:
{'subject': {'Dataset': 'Spider Development Set', 'Model': 'Q â†’ QPL', 'QPL Length': '1', 'Support': '189'}, 'measures': ['Execution Accuracy'], 'outcomes': ['87.3']}

The extracted claim contains the same subject information as this ground truth claim. However, the extracted claim is missing the 'measures' and 'outcomes' information that is present in the ground truth claim. Because of this missing information, I would consider these claims to be different.

<classification>no</classification>

The extracted claim lacks crucial information about the execution accuracy, which is a key part of the experimental result reported in the table. While the context setting (subject) is correct, the absence of the performance metric and its value makes this claim incomplete compared to the ground truth.
