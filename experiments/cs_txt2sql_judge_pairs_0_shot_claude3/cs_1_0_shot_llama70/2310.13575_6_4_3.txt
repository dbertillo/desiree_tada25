To evaluate whether the extracted claim is the same as any of the ground truth claims, I'll compare it to each one:

The extracted claim matches most closely with this ground truth claim:
{'subject': {'Dataset': 'Spider Development Set', 'Model': 'Q â†’ QPL', 'QPL Length': '1', 'Support': '189'}, 'measures': ['Execution Accuracy'], 'outcomes': ['87.3']}

The extracted claim contains the same subject information as this ground truth claim. However, it's missing the 'measures' and 'outcomes' information. Because of this missing crucial information, I would classify this as not being the same claim.

<classification>no</classification>

While the extracted claim captures the context correctly, it fails to include the actual experimental result (Execution Accuracy of 87.3%), which is a key part of the claim. For a claim to be considered the same, it should include both the context and the results of the experiment.
