To evaluate if the extracted claim is the same as any of the ground truth claims, I'll compare the information provided in both.

The extracted claim contains:
- Support: 189
- QPL Length: 1
- Model: Q -> QPL
- Dataset: Spider Development Set

Looking at the ground truth claims, there is one that matches these specifications:

{'subject': {'Dataset': 'Spider Development Set', 'Model': 'Q â†’ QPL', 'QPL Length': '1', 'Support': '189'}, 'measures': ['Execution Accuracy'], 'outcomes': ['87.3']}

This ground truth claim contains all the information from the extracted claim, but it also includes additional information (measures and outcomes) that the extracted claim is missing. 

Since the extracted claim doesn't contain all the information present in the ground truth claim, they are not exactly the same.

<classification>no</classification>

The extracted claim is incomplete compared to the ground truth, as it's missing the Execution Accuracy measure and its corresponding outcome value of 87.3%.
