To evaluate if the extracted claim is the same as any of the ground truth claims, I'll compare the information contained in both.

The extracted claim contains:
- Support: 189
- QPL Length: 1
- Model: Q -> QPL
- Dataset: Spider Development Set

Looking at the ground truth claims, there is one that matches these specifications:

{'subject': {'Dataset': 'Spider Development Set', 'Model': 'Q â†’ QPL', 'QPL Length': '1', 'Support': '189'}, 'measures': ['Execution Accuracy'], 'outcomes': ['87.3']}

This ground truth claim contains all the information present in the extracted claim. However, the extracted claim is missing the measure (Execution Accuracy) and the outcome (87.3%).

Since the extracted claim does not contain all the information present in the ground truth claim, they are not the same.

<classification>no</classification>

The extracted claim is incomplete compared to the ground truth, as it's missing the performance metric and its value.
