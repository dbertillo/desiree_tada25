To evaluate if the extracted claim is the same as any of the ground truth claims, I'll compare the information in the extracted claim to each ground truth claim.

The extracted claim contains:
- Support: 189
- QPL Length: 1
- Model: Q -> QPL
- Dataset: Spider Development Set

This matches exactly with the first ground truth claim:
{'subject': {'Dataset': 'Spider Development Set', 'Model': 'Q â†’ QPL', 'QPL Length': '1', 'Support': '189'}, 'measures': ['Execution Accuracy'], 'outcomes': ['87.3']}

However, the extracted claim is missing the 'measures' and 'outcomes' information that is present in the ground truth claim. Because of this missing information, the extracted claim is not considered the same as the ground truth claim.

<classification>no</classification>

While the extracted claim correctly identifies some key information, it fails to capture the complete experimental result by omitting the execution accuracy measure and its corresponding outcome value. This omission makes the extracted claim incomplete compared to the ground truth.
