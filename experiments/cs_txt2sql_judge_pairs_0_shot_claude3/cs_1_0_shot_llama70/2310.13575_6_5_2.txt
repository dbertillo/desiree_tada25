To evaluate if the extracted claim matches any of the ground truth claims, I'll compare the key-value pairs in the extracted claim with those in the ground truth claims.

The extracted claim has:
- Support: 189
- QPL Length: 1
- Model: Q+QD -> QPL
- Dataset: Spider Development Set

Looking at the ground truth claims, there is one that matches these specifications:

{'subject': {'Dataset': 'Spider Development Set', 'Model': 'Q+QD â†’ QPL', 'QPL Length': '1', 'Support': '189'}, 'measures': ['Execution Accuracy'], 'outcomes': ['78.3']}

All the key-value pairs in the extracted claim match this ground truth claim. However, the extracted claim is missing the 'measures' and 'outcomes' information that is present in the ground truth claim.

Given that the extracted claim contains a subset of the information in the ground truth claim, but is missing crucial experimental results (the execution accuracy), I would classify this as not being the same claim.

<classification>no</classification>

The extracted claim captures the context correctly but fails to include the actual experimental result, which is an essential part of the claim in the ground truth.
