To evaluate if the extracted claim matches any of the ground truth claims, I'll compare the key elements:

1. The extracted claim has:
   - Support: 189
   - QPL Length: 1
   - Model: Q+QD -> QPL
   - Dataset: Spider Development Set

2. Looking at the ground truth claims, there is one that matches these specifications:
   {'subject': {'Dataset': 'Spider Development Set', 'Model': 'Q+QD â†’ QPL', 'QPL Length': '1', 'Support': '189'}, 'measures': ['Execution Accuracy'], 'outcomes': ['78.3']}

The extracted claim matches this ground truth claim in terms of the subject specifications. However, the extracted claim is missing the measure (Execution Accuracy) and the outcome (78.3%). 

Given that the extracted claim contains only a subset of the information present in the ground truth claim and is missing crucial experimental results, I would classify this as not being the same claim.
