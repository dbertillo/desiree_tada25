To evaluate if the extracted claim is the same as any of the ground truth claims, I'll compare the information in both.

The extracted claim contains:
- Support: 189
- QPL Length: 1
- Model: Q+QD -> QPL
- Dataset: Spider Development Set

Looking at the ground truth claims, there is one that matches these specifications:

{'subject': {'Dataset': 'Spider Development Set', 'Model': 'Q+QD â†’ QPL', 'QPL Length': '1', 'Support': '189'}, 'measures': ['Execution Accuracy'], 'outcomes': ['78.3']}

This ground truth claim contains the same information as the extracted claim, plus additional information about the measure and outcome. Since the extracted claim contains a subset of the information in the ground truth claim and doesn't contradict it, we can consider them to be the same claim.
