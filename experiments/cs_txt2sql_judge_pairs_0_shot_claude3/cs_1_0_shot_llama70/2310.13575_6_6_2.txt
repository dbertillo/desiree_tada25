To evaluate if the extracted claim matches any of the ground truth claims, I'll compare the key information:

1. The extracted claim is for the Spider Development Set, which matches all ground truth claims.
2. The extracted claim mentions "Text-to-QPL" as the model, while ground truth claims specify either "Q → QPL" or "Q+QD → QPL".
3. The extracted claim has an Execution Accuracy of 86.6%, which matches only one ground truth claim.
4. The matching ground truth claim is for QPL Length 2, with 277 support, and the model "Q → QPL".

While the extracted claim captures some correct information, it lacks specificity in the model type and QPL Length, which are crucial details in the ground truth claims. Therefore, it cannot be considered an exact match to any single ground truth claim.
