After comparing the extracted claim with the ground truth claims, I can confirm that the extracted claim matches one of the ground truth claims. Specifically, it corresponds to the fourth claim in the ground truth list.

<classification>yes</classification>

The extracted claim and the matching ground truth claim both have:
- QPL Length: 2
- Model: Q+QD â†’ QPL (the arrow is represented differently but means the same thing)
- Dataset: Spider Development Set
- Execution Accuracy: 83.4%

The only difference is that the ground truth claim includes the 'Support' value of 277, which is not present in the extracted claim. However, this doesn't change the core information of the claim, so they can be considered the same.
