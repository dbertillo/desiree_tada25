After comparing the extracted claim with the ground truth claims, I can provide the following classification:

<classification>yes</classification>

The extracted claim matches the first ground truth claim in the list. Both refer to the Column Ambiguity (C) for the Single Stage method, with an Either In Top K (%) evaluation metric and an outcome of 64.0%. The only difference is in the naming convention, but the information conveyed is the same.
