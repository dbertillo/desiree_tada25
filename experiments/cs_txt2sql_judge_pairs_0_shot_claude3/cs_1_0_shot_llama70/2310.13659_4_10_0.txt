To determine if the extracted claim matches any of the ground truth claims, I'll compare the key information:

Extracted claim:
- Kind of Ambiguity: Join Ambiguity (J)
- Evaluation Metric: Either In Top K (%)
- Method: +Template Diversity
- Outcome: 87.1

Looking through the ground truth claims, I find a matching entry:

{'subject': {'Dataset': 'AmbiQT', 'Ambiguity Type': 'J', 'Model': '+Template Diversity', 'Evaluation Type': 'Either In Top K'}, 'measures': ['Execution Match (EXM) accuracy'], 'outcomes': ['87.1']}

This ground truth claim matches the extracted claim in all key aspects:
- Ambiguity Type: J (Join Ambiguity)
- Evaluation Type: Either In Top K
- Model/Method: +Template Diversity
- Outcome: 87.1

Therefore, the extracted claim is the same as this ground truth claim.
