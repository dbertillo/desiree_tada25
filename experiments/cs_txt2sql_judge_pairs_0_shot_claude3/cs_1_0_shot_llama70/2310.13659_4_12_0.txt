After analyzing the extracted claim and the ground truth claims, I can conclude that:

<classification>yes</classification>

The extracted claim corresponds to the following ground truth claim:

{'subject': {'Dataset': 'AmbiQT', 'Ambiguity Type': 'C', 'Model': '+Schema Diversity (Logical Beam)', 'Evaluation Type': 'Either In Top K'}, 'measures': ['Execution Match (EXM) accuracy'], 'outcomes': ['66.6']}

The extracted claim matches this ground truth claim because:
1. The "Kind of Ambiguity" (Column Ambiguity) corresponds to "Ambiguity Type: C"
2. The "Evaluation Metric" (Either In Top K (%)) matches "Evaluation Type: Either In Top K"
3. The "Method" (+Schema Diversity (LogicalBeam)) is the same as "Model: +Schema Diversity (Logical Beam)"
4. The outcome value (66.6) is identical in both claims

While there are some differences in the naming conventions and structure, the essential information conveyed is the same, making these claims equivalent.
