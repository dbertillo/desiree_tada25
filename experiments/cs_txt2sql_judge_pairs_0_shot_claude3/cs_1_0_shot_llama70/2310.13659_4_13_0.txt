After analyzing the extracted claim and the ground truth claims, I can provide the following assessment:

<classification>yes</classification>

The extracted claim corresponds to the ground truth claim:

{'subject': {'Dataset': 'AmbiQT', 'Ambiguity Type': 'T', 'Model': '+Schema Diversity (Logical Beam)', 'Evaluation Type': 'Either In Top K'}, 'measures': ['Execution Match (EXM) accuracy'], 'outcomes': ['67.3']}

The extracted claim matches this ground truth claim because:
1. The "Kind of Ambiguity" (T) corresponds to "Ambiguity Type" (T)
2. The "Evaluation Metric" (Either In Top K (%)) matches "Evaluation Type" (Either In Top K)
3. The "Method" (+Schema Diversity (LogicalBeam)) is the same as the "Model" (+Schema Diversity (Logical Beam))
4. The outcome value (67.3) is identical

While there are some minor differences in naming conventions, the essential information conveyed is the same, making these claims equivalent.
