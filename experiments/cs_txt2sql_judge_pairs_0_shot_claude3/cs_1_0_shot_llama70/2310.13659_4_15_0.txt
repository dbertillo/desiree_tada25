After analyzing the extracted claim and the ground truth claims, I can provide the following assessment:

<classification>yes</classification>

The extracted claim matches one of the ground truth claims. Specifically, it corresponds to the following ground truth claim:

{'subject': {'Dataset': 'AmbiQT', 'Ambiguity Type': 'P', 'Model': '+Schema Diversity (Logical Beam)', 'Evaluation Type': 'Either In Top K'}, 'measures': ['Execution Match (EXM) accuracy'], 'outcomes': ['64.4']}

The extracted claim and this ground truth claim share the same information:
1. The ambiguity type is 'P' (Precomputed Aggregates)
2. The evaluation metric is 'Either In Top K (%)'
3. The method is '+Schema Diversity (LogicalBeam)'
4. The outcome value is 64.4

While there are some differences in the naming conventions and structure, the essential information conveyed is the same, making these claims equivalent.
