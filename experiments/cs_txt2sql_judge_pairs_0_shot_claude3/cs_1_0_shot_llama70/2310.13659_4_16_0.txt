After analyzing the extracted claim and the ground truth claims, I can conclude that:

<classification>yes</classification>

The extracted claim matches one of the ground truth claims. Specifically, it corresponds to the claim:

{'subject': {'Dataset': 'AmbiQT', 'Ambiguity Type': 'C', 'Model': 'Single stage', 'Evaluation Type': 'Both In Top K (Coverage)'}, 'measures': ['Execution Match (EXM) accuracy'], 'outcomes': ['23.2']}

The extracted claim correctly identifies the Kind of Ambiguity as 'Column Ambiguity' (which corresponds to 'C' in the ground truth), the Evaluation Metric as 'Both In Top K (Coverage) (%)', the Method as 'Single Stage', and the outcome value of 23.2%. While there are some differences in naming conventions and structure, the core information is the same.
