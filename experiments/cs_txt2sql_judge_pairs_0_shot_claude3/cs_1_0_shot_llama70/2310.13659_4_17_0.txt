After carefully comparing the extracted claim with the ground truth claims, I can provide the following classification:

<classification>yes</classification>

The extracted claim matches one of the ground truth claims. Specifically, it corresponds to the claim:

{'subject': {'Dataset': 'AmbiQT', 'Ambiguity Type': 'T', 'Model': 'Single stage', 'Evaluation Type': 'Both In Top K (Coverage)'}, 'measures': ['Execution Match (EXM) accuracy'], 'outcomes': ['25.3']}

The extracted claim correctly identifies the Kind of Ambiguity as 'Table Ambiguity' (which corresponds to 'T' in the ground truth), the Evaluation Metric as 'Both In Top K (Coverage) (%)', the Method as 'Single Stage', and the outcome value of 25.3. While there are some differences in naming conventions and structure, the essential information is the same.
