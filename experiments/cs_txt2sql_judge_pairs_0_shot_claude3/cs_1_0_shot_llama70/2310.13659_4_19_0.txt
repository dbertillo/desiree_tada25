After carefully comparing the extracted claim and the ground truth claims, I can provide the following answer:

<classification>yes</classification>

Comment: The extracted claim matches the last ground truth claim in the list. Both refer to the "Precomputed Aggregates" (P) ambiguity type, use the "Single Stage" method, evaluate using "Both In Top K (Coverage) (%)", and have the outcome value of 9.9%. The only difference is in the naming convention, but the information conveyed is the same.
