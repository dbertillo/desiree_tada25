After analyzing the extracted claim and the ground truth claims, I can conclude that:

<classification>yes</classification>

The extracted claim corresponds to the ground truth claim:
{'subject': {'Dataset': 'AmbiQT', 'Ambiguity Type': 'C', 'Model': 'Two stages', 'Evaluation Type': 'Both In Top K (Coverage)'}, 'measures': ['Execution Match (EXM) accuracy'], 'outcomes': ['16.0']}

The extracted claim matches this ground truth claim in terms of:
1. The ambiguity type (Column Ambiguity, which corresponds to 'C')
2. The evaluation metric (Both In Top K (Coverage) (%))
3. The method (Two Stages)
4. The outcome value (16.0)

While there are some differences in how the information is presented (e.g., 'Dataset' is not explicitly mentioned in the extracted claim), the core information is the same, making these claims equivalent.
