To determine if the extracted claim matches any of the ground truth claims, I'll compare the key information:

Extracted claim:
- Kind of Ambiguity: Join Ambiguity (J)
- Evaluation Metric: Both In Top K (Coverage) (%)
- Method: Two Stages
- Outcome: 54.5

Looking through the ground truth claims, I find this matching claim:

{'subject': {'Dataset': 'AmbiQT', 'Ambiguity Type': 'J', 'Model': 'Two stages', 'Evaluation Type': 'Both In Top K (Coverage)'}, 'measures': ['Execution Match (EXM) accuracy'], 'outcomes': ['54.5']}

This ground truth claim matches the extracted claim in all key aspects:
- Ambiguity Type: J (Join)
- Evaluation Type: Both In Top K (Coverage)
- Model: Two stages
- Outcome: 54.5

Therefore, the extracted claim and this ground truth claim are the same.
