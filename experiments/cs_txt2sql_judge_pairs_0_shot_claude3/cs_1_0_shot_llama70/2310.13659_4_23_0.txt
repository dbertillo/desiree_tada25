After comparing the extracted claim with the ground truth claims, I can conclude:

<classification>yes</classification>

The extracted claim matches one of the ground truth claims. Specifically, it corresponds to the claim:

{'subject': {'Dataset': 'AmbiQT', 'Ambiguity Type': 'P', 'Model': 'Two stages', 'Evaluation Type': 'Both In Top K (Coverage)'}, 'measures': ['Execution Match (EXM) accuracy'], 'outcomes': ['27.7']}

The extracted claim correctly identifies:
- The evaluation metric as "Both In Top K (Coverage) (%)"
- The method as "Two Stages"
- The outcome value as 27.7

The only difference is that the extracted claim uses "Precomputed Aggregates" for the ambiguity type, while the ground truth uses "P". However, "P" is likely an abbreviation for "Precomputed Aggregates" based on the context provided in the table, so this is essentially the same information.
