After comparing the extracted claim with the ground truth claims, I can confirm that the extracted claim matches one of the ground truth claims.

<classification>yes</classification>

The extracted claim corresponds to the ground truth claim:
{'subject': {'Dataset': 'AmbiQT', 'Ambiguity Type': 'C', 'Model': '+Template Diversity', 'Evaluation Type': 'Both In Top K (Coverage)'}, 'measures': ['Execution Match (EXM) accuracy'], 'outcomes': ['16.1']}

The key details match:
1. The ambiguity type (Column Ambiguity or 'C')
2. The evaluation metric (Both In Top K (Coverage))
3. The method (+Template Diversity)
4. The outcome value (16.1)

While there are some differences in how the information is presented (e.g., 'Dataset' is not explicitly mentioned in the extracted claim), the core information is the same, making this a match.
