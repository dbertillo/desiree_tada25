After analyzing the extracted claim and the ground truth claims, I can conclude that:

<classification>yes</classification>

The extracted claim matches one of the ground truth claims. Specifically, it corresponds to the claim:

{'subject': {'Dataset': 'AmbiQT', 'Ambiguity Type': 'J', 'Model': '+Template Diversity', 'Evaluation Type': 'Both In Top K (Coverage)'}, 'measures': ['Execution Match (EXM) accuracy'], 'outcomes': ['62.2']}

The extracted claim correctly identifies the Kind of Ambiguity as 'Join Ambiguity' (which corresponds to 'J' in the ground truth), the Evaluation Metric as 'Both In Top K (Coverage) (%)', and the Method as '+Template Diversity'. The outcome value of 62.2 also matches. While there are some differences in naming conventions and additional details in the ground truth claim, the core information is the same, making these claims equivalent.
