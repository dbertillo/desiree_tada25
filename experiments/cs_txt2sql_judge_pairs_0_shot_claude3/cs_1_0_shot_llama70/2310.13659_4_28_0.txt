After comparing the extracted claim with the ground truth claims, I can provide the following classification:

<classification>yes</classification>

The extracted claim matches with one of the ground truth claims. Specifically, it corresponds to the claim:

{'subject': {'Dataset': 'AmbiQT', 'Ambiguity Type': 'C', 'Model': '+Schema Diversity (Logical Beam)', 'Evaluation Type': 'Both In Top K (Coverage)'}, 'measures': ['Execution Match (EXM) accuracy'], 'outcomes': ['28.0']}

The extracted claim correctly identifies the Kind of Ambiguity as Column Ambiguity (which corresponds to 'C' in the ground truth), the Evaluation Metric as 'Both In Top K (Coverage) (%)', and the Method as '+Schema Diversity (LogicalBeam)'. The outcome value of 28.0 also matches. While there are some differences in naming conventions and structure, the essential information is the same, hence the classification as "yes".
