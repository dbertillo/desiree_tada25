After analyzing the extracted claim and the ground truth claims, I can conclude:

<classification>yes</classification>

The extracted claim matches one of the ground truth claims. Specifically, it corresponds to the claim:

{'subject': {'Dataset': 'AmbiQT', 'Ambiguity Type': 'T', 'Model': '+Schema Diversity (Logical Beam)', 'Evaluation Type': 'Both In Top K (Coverage)'}, 'measures': ['Execution Match (EXM) accuracy'], 'outcomes': ['42.6']}

The extracted claim correctly identifies the Kind of Ambiguity as 'Table Ambiguity' (which corresponds to 'T' in the ground truth), the Evaluation Metric as 'Both In Top K (Coverage) (%)', the Method as '+Schema Diversity (LogicalBeam)', and the outcome value of 42.6. While there are some minor differences in naming conventions, the core information is the same.
