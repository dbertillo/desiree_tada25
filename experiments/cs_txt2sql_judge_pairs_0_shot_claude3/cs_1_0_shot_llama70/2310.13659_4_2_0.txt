After analyzing the extracted claim and the ground truth claims, I can conclude that:

<classification>yes</classification>

The extracted claim corresponds to the ground truth claim:
{'subject': {'Dataset': 'AmbiQT', 'Ambiguity Type': 'J', 'Model': 'Single stage', 'Evaluation Type': 'Either In Top K'}, 'measures': ['Execution Match (EXM) accuracy'], 'outcomes': ['86.8']}

The extracted claim correctly identifies the Kind of Ambiguity as 'Join Ambiguity' (which corresponds to 'J' in the ground truth), the Evaluation Metric as 'Either In Top K (%)', the Method as 'Single Stage', and the outcome value of 86.8. While there are some differences in naming conventions and additional information in the ground truth (like specifying the dataset), the core information is the same, making this the same claim.
