After comparing the extracted claim with the ground truth claims, I can conclude:

<classification>yes</classification>

The extracted claim matches the last claim in the ground truth list. Both refer to the same information:
- Ambiguity Type: P (Precomputed Aggregates)
- Evaluation Type: Both In Top K (Coverage)
- Model: +Schema Diversity (LogicalBeam)
- Measure: Execution Match (EXM) accuracy (implied in the ground truth)
- Outcome: 24.8%

The extracted claim correctly captures the essential information, even though it uses slightly different terminology (e.g., "Kind of Ambiguity" instead of "Ambiguity Type"). The core information and the numerical result are the same, so this can be considered a match.
