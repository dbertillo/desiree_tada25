After analyzing the extracted claim and the ground truth claims, I can provide the following assessment:

<classification>yes</classification>

The extracted claim corresponds to the ground truth claim:
{'subject': {'Dataset': 'AmbiQT', 'Ambiguity Type': 'P', 'Model': 'Single stage', 'Evaluation Type': 'Either In Top K'}, 'measures': ['Execution Match (EXM) accuracy'], 'outcomes': ['58.4']}

The extracted claim matches this ground truth claim because:
1. The "Kind of Ambiguity" (P) in the extracted claim corresponds to "Ambiguity Type" (P) in the ground truth.
2. The "Method" (Single Stage) in the extracted claim matches the "Model" (Single stage) in the ground truth.
3. The "Evaluation Metric" (Either In Top K (%)) in the extracted claim aligns with the "Evaluation Type" (Either In Top K) in the ground truth.
4. The outcome value (58.4) is the same in both claims.

While there are some differences in the naming conventions and structure, the essential information conveyed is the same, making these claims equivalent.
