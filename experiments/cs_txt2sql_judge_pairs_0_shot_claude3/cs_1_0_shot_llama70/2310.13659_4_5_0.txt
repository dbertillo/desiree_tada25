To evaluate if the extracted claim matches any of the ground truth claims, I'll compare the key information:

1. The extracted claim is for "Table Ambiguity" (T), "Either In Top K (%)", and "Two Stages" method.
2. The outcome value is 66.2.

Looking at the ground truth claims, I find a matching entry:

{'subject': {'Dataset': 'AmbiQT', 'Ambiguity Type': 'T', 'Model': 'Two stages', 'Evaluation Type': 'Either In Top K'}, 'measures': ['Execution Match (EXM) accuracy'], 'outcomes': ['66.2']}

This ground truth claim matches the extracted claim in terms of ambiguity type (T for Table), evaluation type (Either In Top K), model/method (Two stages), and the outcome value (66.2).

Therefore, my classification is:

<classification>yes</classification>

The extracted claim and the corresponding ground truth claim represent the same information, despite some differences in naming conventions (e.g., "Table Ambiguity" vs "T", "Two Stages" vs "Two stages").
