To determine if the extracted claim matches any of the ground truth claims, I'll compare the key information:

Extracted claim:
- Kind of Ambiguity: Join Ambiguity (J)
- Evaluation Metric: Either In Top K (%)
- Method: Two Stages
- Outcome: 88.5

The matching ground truth claim would be:
{'subject': {'Dataset': 'AmbiQT', 'Ambiguity Type': 'J', 'Model': 'Two stages', 'Evaluation Type': 'Either In Top K'}, 'measures': ['Execution Match (EXM) accuracy'], 'outcomes': ['88.5']}

This ground truth claim matches the extracted claim in all key aspects:
- Ambiguity Type: J (Join Ambiguity)
- Evaluation Type: Either In Top K
- Model: Two stages
- Outcome: 88.5

Therefore, the extracted claim and this ground truth claim are the same.
