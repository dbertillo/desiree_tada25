After comparing the extracted claim with the ground truth claims, I can provide the following answer:

<classification>yes</classification>

The extracted claim corresponds to the ground truth claim:
{'subject': {'Dataset': 'AmbiQT', 'Ambiguity Type': 'T', 'Model': '+Template Diversity', 'Evaluation Type': 'Either In Top K'}, 'measures': ['Execution Match (EXM) accuracy'], 'outcomes': ['65.0']}

The extracted claim matches this ground truth claim in terms of:
1. The ambiguity type (T for Table Ambiguity)
2. The evaluation metric (Either In Top K)
3. The method (+Template Diversity)
4. The outcome value (65.0)

While there are some differences in how the information is presented (e.g., 'Kind of Ambiguity' vs 'Ambiguity Type', 'Evaluation Metric' vs 'Evaluation Type'), the core information conveyed is the same. Therefore, these claims can be considered equivalent.
