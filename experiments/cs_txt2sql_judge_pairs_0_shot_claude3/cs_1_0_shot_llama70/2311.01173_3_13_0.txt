After comparing the extracted claim with the ground truth claims, I can conclude:

<classification>yes</classification>

The extracted claim matches one of the ground truth claims. Specifically, it corresponds to the claim for the SpiderUnion dataset, using the CRUSH method, with a budget of 100, and reporting both EM (0.52) and EX (0.62) accuracies. This information is present in the ground truth claims, although split into two separate claims for EM and EX.
