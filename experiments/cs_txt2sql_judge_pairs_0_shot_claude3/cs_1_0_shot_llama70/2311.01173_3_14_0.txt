To evaluate if the extracted claim matches any of the ground truth claims, I'll compare the key information:

1. Dataset: BirdUnion (matches)
2. Method: Single DPR(OpenAI) (matches)
3. Budget: 3 (matches)
4. Measures: EM (0.03) and EX (0.07)

Looking at the ground truth claims, there are two relevant entries:

1. {'subject': {'Dataset': 'BirdUnion', 'Method': 'Single DPR(OpenAI)', 'Budget': '3', 'Model': 'RESDSQL'}, 'measures': ['Execution Match (EX) accuracy'], 'outcomes': ['0.07']}

2. There isn't an explicit entry for EM (Exact Match) for this configuration, but we can infer it should exist based on the pattern in other entries.

The extracted claim contains both EM and EX measures, while the ground truth separates them into individual claims. However, the values match for the EX measure (0.07).

Given that the extracted claim contains the same information as the ground truth (plus the EM measure which is likely correct but not explicitly stated in the given ground truth), we can consider them to be essentially the same claim.
