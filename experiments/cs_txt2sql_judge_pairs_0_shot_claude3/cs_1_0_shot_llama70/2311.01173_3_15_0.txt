After comparing the extracted claim with the ground truth claims, I can conclude:

<classification>yes</classification>

The extracted claim matches one of the ground truth claims. Specifically, it corresponds to the claim for the BirdUnion dataset, using the Single DPR(OpenAI) method, with a budget of 5. The EM (Exact Match) accuracy of 0.05 and EX (Execution Match) accuracy of 0.10 match the values in the ground truth. The only difference is that the extracted claim combines both EM and EX measures into a single claim, while the ground truth separates them into two claims. However, the information content is the same, so it can be considered the same claim.
