After comparing the extracted claim with the ground truth claims, I can provide the following answer:

<classification>yes</classification>

Comment: The extracted claim matches one of the ground truth claims. Specifically, it corresponds to the claim for the BirdUnion dataset, using the Single DPR(OpenAI) method, with a budget of 10. The EM (Exact Match) accuracy of 0.07 and EX (Execution Match) accuracy of 0.13 are consistent between the extracted claim and the ground truth. The only difference is that the extracted claim includes both EM and EX in a single claim, while the ground truth separates them into two claims. However, the information content is the same, so I've classified it as a match.
