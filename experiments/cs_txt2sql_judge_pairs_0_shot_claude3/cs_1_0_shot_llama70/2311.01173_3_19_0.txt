After comparing the extracted claim with the ground truth claims, I can provide the following answer:

<classification>yes</classification>

The extracted claim matches one of the ground truth claims. Specifically, it corresponds to the claim for the BirdUnion dataset, using the Single DPR(OpenAI) method, with a budget of 50. The EM (Exact Match) accuracy of 0.10 and EX (Execution Match) accuracy of 0.18 match the values in the ground truth claim. The only difference is that the ground truth claim explicitly mentions the RESDSQL model, which is implied in the context but not explicitly stated in the extracted claim. However, the core information is the same, so I've classified it as a match.
