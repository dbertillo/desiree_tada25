After comparing the extracted claim with the ground truth claims, I can provide the following answer:

<classification>yes</classification>

The extracted claim matches one of the ground truth claims. Specifically, it corresponds to the claim:

{'subject': {'Dataset': 'BirdUnion', 'Method': 'CRUSH', 'Budget': '30', 'Model': 'RESDSQL'}, 'measures': ['Execution Match (EX) accuracy'], 'outcomes': ['0.19']}

The extracted claim contains both EM and EX measures, while the ground truth separates them into individual claims. However, the information for the EX measure is identical, and the EM measure (0.11) is also correct based on the table in the context. Therefore, we can consider this a match.
