After comparing the extracted claim with the ground truth claims, I can provide the following answer:

<classification>yes</classification>

The extracted claim matches one of the ground truth claims. Specifically, it corresponds to the last claim in the ground truth list, which has the following details:
- Dataset: BirdUnion
- Method: CRUSH
- Budget: 50
- Model: RESDSQL (implied from context)
- Measure: Execution Match (EX) accuracy
- Outcome: 0.21

The extracted claim contains this information, along with an additional Exact Match (EM) accuracy measure, which is not present in the ground truth claim but is consistent with the data presented in the table.
