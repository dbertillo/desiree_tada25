The extracted claim and the ground truth claims are not the same. The extracted claim refers to the BirdUnion dataset with CRUSH method and a budget of 100, but it has no measures or outcomes. In contrast, none of the ground truth claims match these exact specifications. The closest ground truth claims for BirdUnion with CRUSH method only go up to a budget of 50, and they all include measures and outcomes. Therefore, these are not the same claims.
