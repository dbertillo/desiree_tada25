After comparing the extracted claim with the ground truth claims, I can conclude:

<classification>yes</classification>

The extracted claim matches two of the ground truth claims combined:

1. {'subject': {'Dataset': 'SpiderUnion', 'Method': 'Single DPR(OpenAI)', 'Budget': '10', 'Model': 'RESDSQL'}, 'measures': ['Exact Match (EM) accuracy'], 'outcomes': ['0.45']}

2. {'subject': {'Dataset': 'SpiderUnion', 'Method': 'Single DPR(OpenAI)', 'Budget': '10', 'Model': 'RESDSQL'}, 'measures': ['Execution Match (EX) accuracy'], 'outcomes': ['0.53']}

The extracted claim combines both EM and EX measures and outcomes into a single claim, while the ground truth separates them. However, all the information is consistent and represents the same experimental result.
