After comparing the extracted claim with the ground truth claims, I can provide the following assessment:

<classification>yes</classification>

The extracted claim matches one of the ground truth claims. Specifically, it corresponds to the claim for the SpiderUnion dataset, using the Single DPR(OpenAI) method, with a budget of 100. The EM (Exact Match) accuracy of 0.51 and EX (Execution Match) accuracy of 0.62 are consistent between the extracted claim and the relevant ground truth claim.

The only minor difference is that the ground truth claim explicitly mentions the RESDSQL model, which is implied but not directly stated in the extracted claim. However, this doesn't change the core information conveyed by the claim, so it can still be considered the same claim.
